<p>Morgan's campaigns furnish one of the amplest
chapters of Buccaneer history. Equally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
daring, but less cruel than Lolonnois, less
fanatical than Montbars, and less generous
and honest than De Lussan or Sharp, he
appears to have been the only freebooting
leader who obtained any formal recognition
from the English government. From an old
pamphlet, we find, that the expedition to
Panama was undertaken under the commission
and with the full approbation of the
English governor of Jamaica.</p>

<p>Sir Henry Morgan was the son of a Welsh
farmer, of easy circumstances, "as most who
bear that name in Wales are known to be,"
says Esquemeling, his Dutch historian. Taking
an early dislike to the monotonous, unadventurous
life of his father's house, he ran
away from home, and, coming to the coast,
turned sailor, and went to sea.</p>

<p>Embarking on board a vessel bound for
Barbadoes, that lay with several others in
the port, he engaged himself in the usual
way to a planter's agent, who resold him for
three years immediately on his arrival in the
West Indies. Having served his time and
obtained his hard-earned liberty, he repaired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
to Jamaica, a place of which wild stories
were told all over the Main. He resolved to
seek his fortune at that El Dorado, and
arriving there, saw two Buccaneer vessels
just fitting out for an expedition. Being
now in search of employment, and finding
this suit his daring and restless spirit, he
determined to embrace the life of a Flibustier.
The gentlemen of fortune were successful,
and had not been long at sea before they
took a valuable prize.</p>

<p>This early success was as fatal to Morgan
as good luck is to a young gambler on his
first visit to a hell. It roused his ambition,
heightened his hope, and encouraged him
to continue a career so auspiciously begun.
He followed the Buccaneer chiefs, and learnt
their manners of living. In the course of
only three or four voyages, he signalized
himself so much as to acquire the reputation
of a good soldier, remarkable for his valour
and success. He was a good shot, and renowned
for his intrepidity, coolness, and
determination. He seemed to foresee all
contingencies, and set about his schemes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
with a firm confidence that insured their
success.</p>

<p>Having already laid by much money, and
being fortunate both in his voyages and in gambling,
Morgan agreed with a few rich comerades
to join stock, and to buy a vessel, of which
he was unanimously appointed commander.
Such was the usual beginning of an adventurer's
career. Setting out from Jamaica, he
soon became remarkable for the number of
prizes which he took, his well known stations
being round the coast of Campeachy. With
these prizes he returned triumphantly to
Jamaica, his name established as a terror to
the Spaniard, and a war-cry to the English.
Finding Mansvelt, an old Buccaneer, lying
in harbour, about to start on a grand expedition
to the mainland, he joined him, and was
at once elected as vice-admiral of a small
fleet of fifteen vessels and 600 men, part
English and part French.</p>

<p>They sailed first to the island of St.
Catherine, near the continent of Costa Rica,
and distant about thirty-five degrees from
the river of Chagres. Here they made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
first descent, and found the Spaniards well
entrenched in forts, strongly built of hewn
stone, but landing most of their men they
soon forced the garrisons to surrender. Morgan
distinguished himself remarkably in this
expedition, forcing even his very enemies to
laud his skill and valour. He now proceeded
to demolish all the castles but one, in which
he placed 100 men, and the slaves and
prisoners, and proceeded to attack a small
neighbouring island. In a few days they
threw over a bridge to join it to St.
Catherine's, and conveyed over it all the larger
ordnance which they had taken, laying waste
their first conquest with fire and sword.
They then set sail again, having first set their
prisoners ashore near Portobello, intending to
cruise along Costa Rica, as far as the river
Colla, and burn and pillage all the towns up
to Nata. They had, in fact, only taken the
island in order to procure a guide who could
lead them on their way to Nata, knowing
that the Spaniards used St. Catherine's as a
depôt for their prisoners of all nations. The
first step towards a Buccaneer expedition was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
to procure a guide. They found, to their
delight, a mulatto who knew Nata, and who
undertook to lead them to the destruction of
a people whom he hated. It is probable, too,
that Mansvelt had already projected founding
a colony at St. Catherine's, which might be
neither dependent on the French nor the English.
But their schemes were frustrated, for
the governor of Panama, hearing of their
approach, and of their past success, advanced
to meet them with a body of men, and compelled
them to retreat suddenly, for the whole
country was now alarmed and their plans all
known.</p>

<p>Morgan, however, seeing St. Catherine's to
be a well-fortified island, easily defended, and
important as to situation, because its harbour
was good and near the Spanish settlements,
resolved to hold it, appointing as governor
Le Sieur Simon, a Frenchman, whom he left
behind, with a garrison of 100 men. St.
Simon had behaved well in his absence, and
put the island in a good posture of defence,
had strengthened the four large forts, and
turned the smaller island into a citadel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
guarding carefully the three accessible spots,
planting vegetables and clearing plantations
in the smaller island, where abundance of
fresh water could be procured, providing
victual enough for the fleet for two voyages.</p>

<p>The two commanders now determined to
return to Jamaica, promising to send recruits
to Simon, for fear of an invasion, and themselves
to bring speedy succours, intending to
make the island a sanctuary and refuge for
the brotherhood of both nations. The governor
of Jamaica refused to accede to Mansvelt's
requests for soldiers, afraid to weaken the
forces of the island without permission from
England. Mansvelt, worn out with delay,
hastened to Tortuga, and died while collecting
volunteers, his plans being still in embryo.
Had his scheme succeeded, and been
pushed with energy, the Buccaneers might
have founded a republic, and have eventually
driven the Spaniards out of the
Indies.</p>

<p>While Simon was impatiently expecting
succour from Jamaica, and astonished at
Mansvelt's really unavoidable silence, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Spaniards were preparing to smoke out the
wasps' nest that lay so dangerously near their
orchard. A new governor of Costa Rica
threw unusual decision into their plans.
Fearing they should lose the Indies piecemeal,
they resolved to crush the evil ere it grew
indestructible. Don Juan Perez de Guzman
equipped a fleet of four vessels with fifty or
sixty men each, commanded by Don Joseph
Sancho Ximenes, major-general of the garrison
of Porto Bello. Don Juan, in a letter to Simon,
promised him a reward if he would surrender
the island to his Catholic Majesty, and threatened
him with punishment if he resisted.
Simon, seeing the impossibility and uselessness
of resistance, surrendered it after a few
shots, on the same condition with which
Morgan had obtained it from the enemy.</p>

<p>The Spaniards made much of their victory,
publishing "a true relation and particular
account of the victory obtained by the arms
of his Catholic Majesty, against the English
pirates, by the direction and valour of Don
Juan Perez de Guzman, knight of the order
of St. James, governor and captain-general of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
Terra Firma, and the province of Veraguas."</p>

<p>The account goes on to describe the arrival
of fourteen English vessels on the coast,
1665, their arrival at Puerto de Naos, and the
capture of St. Catherine's from the governor,
Don Estevan del Campo, the enemy landing
unperceived. Upon this the valorous Don
Juan called a council of war, wherein he declared
the great progress the said pirates had
made in the dominions of his Catholic Majesty,
and propounded, "that it was absolutely
necessary to send some forces to the
isle of St. Catherine, sufficient to retake it
from the pirates, the honour and interest of
his Majesty of Spain being very narrowly
concerned herein, otherwise the pirates, by
such conquests, might <i>easily</i>, in course of
time, possess themselves of 'all the countries
thereabout.'" The less vapouring, or more
pacific, ingeniously proposed to leave the
pirates alone till they perished for want of
provisions, but Don Juan, overruling their
timidity, sent stores to the militia of Porto
Bello, and conveyed himself there, with no
small danger of his life. At this port he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
found the <i>St. Vincent</i>, a good ship, belonging
to the Negro Company, which he equipped
with a crew of 270 soldiers, thirty-seven
prisoners, thirty-two of the Spanish garrison,
twenty-nine mulattos of Panama, twelve
Indian archers, seven gunners, two lieutenants,
two pilots, a surgeon, and a Franciscan
chaplain. Before they set sail, Don
Juan (<i>who did not go with them</i>) encouraged
them to fight against the enemies of their
country and their religion, "those inhuman
pirates who had committed so many horrid
cruelties upon the subjects of his Catholic
Majesty," promising liberal rewards to all
who behaved themselves well in the service
of their king and country. At Carthagena,
they received a reinforcement of one frigate,
one galleon, a boat, and 127 men.</p>

<p>On arriving at the island, the pirates discharged
three guns, refused to surrender,
and declared they preferred to lose their
lives. The next day three negro deserters,
swimming to the admiral, told him there
were only seventy-two men on the island,
and two days after the day of the Assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
the Spaniards landed and commenced
the affray. The <i>St. Vincent</i> attacked the
Conception battery, the <i>St. Peter</i> the St.
James's forts, the pirates driving off many of
the enemy by loading their guns with part
of the pipes of a church organ, threescore
pipes at a time. The pirates lost six men before
surrendering, the Spaniards one. They
found in the island 800 lbs. of powder, and
250 lbs. of bullets. Two Spanish deserters,
discovered amongst the prisoners, were "shot
to death" the next day. The prisoners were
transported to Puerto Velo, all but three,
who, by order of the governor, were kept as
a trophy, like chained Samsons, to work in
the castle of St. Jerome at Panama, a fortress
building by the governor at his own expense.</p>

<p>A day or two after this unavoidable surrender,
a vessel arrived at St. Catherine,
bringing reinforcements and provisions from
the governor of Jamaica, who had repented
of his rejection of Mansvelt's proposal, but
had not even yet the courage to be boldly
dishonest. The Spaniards, hoisting an English
flag, persuaded Simon to welcome it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
betray it into their hands. There were fourteen
men on board and two women, all of
whom were made prisoners.</p>

<p>On the death of Mansvelt, Morgan became
without opposition the leader of all the adventurers
of Jamaica. He at once published
far and wide his intention of setting out on
a grand expedition, and named Cuba as a
rendezvous, St. Catherine's not being far distant.
Morgan had been no less anxious than
Mansvelt to make this island a fortress and
a storehouse. He had written to the merchants
of Virginia and New England, to contract
with them for ammunition and provisions;
but this hope being ended by the Spanish
conquest, he felt himself free to embark on
a wider and more ambitious field. His plans
were for a moment defeated, but his courage
and ambition were not a whit humbled.</p>

<p>Two months spent in the southern ports of
Cuba sufficed him to collect a fleet of twelve
sail, with 700 fighting men, part English,
part French, resolved to follow him to the
death. To prevent the disunion so frequent
between the two nations, Morgan had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
clause inserted in the charter-party, empowering
him to condemn to instant death
any adventurer who killed or wounded another.
A council was then called to decide
on what place they should first fall. Some
proposed Santiago, which had been before
sacked, others a swoop on the tobacco of the
Havannah, or the dye-woods of Campeachy.
Many voices were strong for a night assault
on the Havannah, which, they said, could be
taken before the castle could be ready to
defend itself. The very ransom of the
clergy they might carry off, would be worth
more than the pillage of a smaller town.
But some Buccaneers, who had been prisoners
there, said nothing could be done with
less than 1500 men, and the proposal was
abandoned, when they proved that they must
first go to the island de los Pinos, and land
in small boats at Matamana, fourteen leagues
from the city.</p>

<p>At last some one proposed a visit to Port-au-Prince,
a town of Cuba, very rich from its
traffic in hides, and which, being far inland
and built on a plain, could be very easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
surprised. The speaker knew the city well,
and was sure that it never had been sacked.
Despairing of collecting forces enough to
attempt the Havannah, they pursued the
Spaniard's plan. Morgan at once acceded to
this scheme, and, giving the captain the signal
of weighing anchor, steered for Port St.
Mary, the nearest harbour to Port-au-Prince.
The night of their arrival in the bay a
Spanish prisoner threw himself into the sea,
and swimming on shore went to inform the
governor of the Buccaneers' plans, having,
with a scanty knowledge of English, gathered
a full insight, deeper than history tells us, of
Morgan's intentions.</p>

<p>The governor instantly sent to the neighbouring
town for succour, and collected, in a
few hours, a force of 800 armed freemen and
slaves, occupying a pass which the Buccaneers
must traverse. He cut down the trees,
barricaded the approaches, and planned eight
ambuscades, strengthened by cannon to play
upon them on their march. He then marched
out into a savannah, where he might see the
Buccaneers at a long distance.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p>The townsmen, in the meanwhile, prepared
for the worst with the usual timidity of the
rich, hiding their riches and carrying away
their movables. The adventurers, on entering
the place, found the paths almost impassable
with trees, but, supposing themselves
discovered, took to the woods, and thus
fortunately escaped the ambuscade.</p>

<p>The governor, seeing the enemy, to his
astonishment, emerge from the trees into the
plain, instantly ordered his cavalry to surround
them as he would have done a troop of
wolves, intending to disperse them first with
his horse and then pursue them with his
main body. The Buccaneers, nothing daunted
by the flashing of the spears or the tramp of
the horsemen, advanced boldly, with drums
beating and colours displayed. They drew
up in a semicircle to receive the charge, and
advanced swiftly towards the enemy, not
waiting to be attacked. The Spaniards
charged them hotly for a while, but, finding
their enemies dexterous at their arms,
moving their feet forward rather than backward;
and seeing their governor and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
of their companions dead at their feet, fled
headlong to the town; those who escaped
towards the wood were killed before they
could reach it. The Buccaneers with few men
either killed or wounded, advancing still in
their phalanx, killed without mercy all they
met, for the space of the four hours that the
fight lasted. The fugitives of the town
barred themselves in their houses and kept
up a fire from the windows and loopholes.
The shots from the roofs and balconies still
continuing, though the town was taken, the
Buccaneers threatened, if the firing did not
cease, to set the town in a flame, and cut the
women and children in pieces before the
eyes of the survivors.</p>

<p>Having thus silenced all resistance, Morgan
drove all his prisoners, men, women,
children, and slaves, into the cathedral, where
he placed a guard. He then gave the
town over to pillage, for the benefit of his
joint-stock company, finding much that was
valuable, but little money, so skilful had the
Spaniards grown in hiding. Parties were
next sent out, as usual, to plunder the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
suburbs, and bring in provisions and prisoners
for the torture.</p>

<p>The revelry then began, while the prisoners
were allowed to starve in the churches; old
women and children were daily tortured to
make them disclose where their money was
hidden.</p>

<p>The monks had been the first to fly from
the English heretics, but bands of them were
frequently captured in the woods, and thrown,
half dead with fear, to confess the dying in
the prisons. When pillage and provisions
grew scanty, and they themselves began to
feel the privations they had inflicted on others,
the Buccaneers resolved to depart, after fifteen
days' residence, a favourite time with the
brotherhood.</p>

<p>They now demanded a double ransom of
their chief prisoners; first, for themselves,
under pain of being transported to Jamaica;
and secondly, for the town, or it would be
burned to the ground. Four merchants were
chosen to collect the contributions, and some
Spaniards were first tortured in their presence,
to increase the zeal of their applications.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
After a few days, they returned empty-handed,
and demanded a respite of fifteen
days, which Morgan granted. They had
searched all the woods, they said, and found
none of their countrymen. Delay now grew
dangerous&mdash;a party of foragers had captured
a negro, with letters from the governor of
Santiago, telling the citizens not to make too
much haste to pay the ransom, but to put off
the pirates with excuses till he could come
to their aid. Enraged at what he deemed
treachery, Morgan swore he would have no
more delay, and would burn the town the
next day if the ransom was not paid down,
but not alluding to the detected letter, and
betraying no apprehension. Still unable to
obtain money, Morgan consented to take 500
oxen, which he insisted on the Spaniards
placing on board his ships at Port-au-Prince,
together with salt enough to "powder" them,
needing the flesh to re-victual for a fresh and
more profitable expedition.</p>

<p>The same day Morgan left the city, taking
with him six of the principal citizens as
hostages. The next day came the cattle, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
he now required the Spaniards to assist him
in killing and salting them. This was done
in a great hurry, Morgan expecting every
moment the Santiago vessels would appear in
sight. As soon as the butchering was completed
he released his hostages and set sail,
unwilling to fight when nothing could be
gained by victory.</p>

<p>At this juncture, the smouldering jealousy
of the two nations that formed his crews
broke into a flame. The grudges of the last
voyage had been perpetuated, and had grown
into a deep and lasting feud, producing ultimately
a disunion fatal to all increase of the
power of the brotherhood of the coast.</p>

<p>While the prisoners were toiling at salting
the beeves, the sailors employed themselves
in drinking and rejoicing at their success,
cooking the richest morsels while they were
still fresh, and all hands intent on securing
the hot marrow bones, the favourite delicacy
of the hunters of Hispaniola. A Frenchman,
employed as one of the butchers, had drawn
out the dainty and placed it by his side, as a
<i>bonne bouche</i> when his work was over. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
English Buccaneer, more hungry than polite,
passing by, and knowing no reservation of
property in such a republic, snatched up the
reeking bone and carried it off. The Frenchman,
pursuing him with angry vociferations,
challenged him to fight for it, but before
they could reach the place of combat, the
aggressor stabbed his adversary in the back,
and laid him dead on the spot. The Frenchmen,
rising in arms, made it a national
quarrel, and demanded redress. Morgan,
just and impartial by nature and from policy,
arrested the murderer and condemned him to
be instantly shot, declaring that he had a right
to challenge his adversary, but not to stab him
treacherously. &#338;xmelin says, the man was
sent in chains to Jamaica (and there tried
and hung), Morgan promising to see justice
done upon him. The French, however,
remained discontented, lamented the fate of
their comrade, and vowed revenge.</p>

<p>Morgan, not waiting for the governor of
Jamaica to share his spoil, sailed to a small
island, at some distance, to make the dividend.
To the general grief and disgust, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
found the whole amounted to only 60,000
crowns, not enough to pay their debts at
Jamaica: this did not include the silk stuffs
and other merchandise, which gave a poor
pittance of 80 crowns to each man, as the
return for so much danger and privation.</p>

<p>Morgan, as unwilling as the rest to revisit
Port Royal empty-handed, proposed a new
expedition, in search of a greater prize. But
the French, not able to agree with the
English, left the fleet, in spite of all their
commander's persuasions, but still with every
external mark of friendship, entreating to the
last to have justice done to the "<i>infame</i>."</p>

<p>Morgan, who had always placed great
reliance on the courage of the French adventurers,
was not going to relinquish his new
expedition on account of their desertion. He
had inspired his men with courage and the hope
of acquiring riches, and they all resolved to
follow him to the attack of the place, whose
name he would not yet disclose, exciting them
by a mystery, which prevented the possibility
of treachery.</p>

<p>He put forth to sea with eight small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
vessels, but was soon joined by an adventurer
of Jamaica, just returning from Campeachy;
with this new ally, he had now a force of
nine vessels and 470 men, many French
being still among them, and arrived at Costa
Rica with all his fleet safe.</p>

<p>As soon as they sighted land, he disclosed
his design to his captains, and soon after to
all his seamen. He intended to storm Porto
Bello by night, and to put the whole city to
the sack: he was confident of success, because
no one knew of his secret; although some of
his men thought their force too small for such
an enterprise. To these Morgan replied, that
if their number was small, their courage was
great, and the fewer they were the more
booty for each, with the greater prospect of
union and secresy; and upon this, all agreed
unanimously to the design.</p>

<p>By good fortune, or by preconcerted arrangement,
one of Morgan's crew turned out
to be an Englishman who, only a short
time before, had been a prisoner at Porto
Bello, and his past sufferings now proved
to have been the foundation of his future<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
good fortune. Having escaped from that
place, he knew every inch of the coast,
which had been so painfully impressed on
his mind, and Morgan submitted, with perfect
confidence, to his guidance. By his
advice, they steered straight for the bay of
Santa Maria, arriving there purposely about
dusk, and reached a spot about twelve
leagues from the city, without meeting any
vessel. They then sailed up the river to
Puerto Pontin, four leagues distant, taking
advantage of the land wind that sprang up,
cool and fresh, at night.</p>

<p>They here anchored, and embarked in
boats, leaving a few men to bring on the
ships. Rowing softly, they reached about
midnight a place called Estera de Longa
lemos, where they all landed, and marched
upon the outposts of the city.</p>

<p>Michael Scott describes Porto Bello as
built in a miserable, dirty, damp hole, surrounded
by high forest-clad hills, wreathed
in mist, and reeking with dirt and fever.
Everlasting vapours obscure the sun, and
mingle with the exhalation of the steaming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
marshes of the lead-coloured, land-locked cove
that forms the harbour.</p>

<p>They were now within reach of the
strongest city in the Spanish West Indies,
except Havannah and Carthagena, the port
of Panama, and the great mart for silver and
negroes. Leaving as usual a party to guard
the boats, and preceded by their guide, they
began halfway to the town to prepare their
arms. Upon approaching the first sentinel,
Morgan sent forward the guide and three
or four others to surprise him. They did it
cunningly, before he could fire his musket,
and brought him with his hands bound to
Morgan, who, threatening him with death,
asked him how things in the city went, and
what forces they had, making a "thousand
menaces to kill him if he did not speak the
truth." The terrified Spaniard informed
them that the town was well garrisoned, but
that there were very few inhabitants; the
merchants only residing in the town while
the galleons are loading, and that he would
be able to take the place in spite of all the
fortresses and the 300 soldiers. Morgan then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
pushed on to the fort, carrying the man
bound before them, and after a quarter of a
league reached the castle, where the man's
company was stationed, closely surrounding
it, so that no one could get in or go out. The
prisoner had in vain attempted to avoid this
redoubt, to which he had served as picket,
encouraged by Morgan's promises of reward,
and avowal that he would not give him up to
his countrymen.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, finding the sentinel gone,
had already spread the alarm of the Buccaneers'
approach. From beneath the walls
Morgan commanded the sentinel to summon
the garrison to surrender at once to his discretion,
or they should be cut in pieces
without quarter. Not regarding these threats,
the Spaniards began instantly to discharge
their guns and muskets to alarm the town
and obtain succour. But though they made
a good resistance they were soon overpowered,
and the Buccaneers, driving them into one
room, set fire to the powder which lay about
on the floor, and blew the tower and its
defenders together into the air; all the survivors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
they put to the sword, in order to
strike terror in the city.</p>

<p>At daybreak they fell upon the city, and
found the inhabitants, some still asleep and
others scared and alarmed; many had thought
of nothing but hiding their treasure, and only
the professional soldier prepared for resistance.
The governor, unable to rally the
citizens, fled into the citadel, and fired upon
the town as well as the enemy. The
frightened herd, stupid with fear, were
throwing their money and jewels into wells
and cisterns, or burying their treasure
in their courtyards, cellars, gardens, and
chapels. The adventurers, abstaining from
pillage, sent a chosen party to the convents
to make prisoners of the religious, male and
female; while another division prepared
ladders to escalade the fort, not relaxing for
a moment either in attack or defence. They
attempted in vain to burn down a castle-gate
which proved to be of iron, and baffled
their efforts, and kept up a warm fire at the
embrasures, aiming with such dexterity at
the mouths of the guns as to kill a gunner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
or two every time the pieces were either
run out or loaded.</p>

<p>The firing continued from daybreak till
noon, and even then the result seemed doubtful,
for when the adventurers approached the
walls with their grenades to burn the doors
the defenders threw down upon them earthen
pots full of powder, and lighted by a fusee,
together with showers of stones and other
missiles. Morgan himself began to despair
of success, and did not know how to escape
from that strait, when the English flag arose
above the smaller fort, and a troop of men
ran forth to proclaim victory with shouts of
joy. The remaining castle, however, was
the <i>pièce de resistance</i>, being the storehouse
of the church plate, and the wealth of the
richer citizens now with the garrison. A
stratagem was suggested, appealing strongly
to Spanish superstition, and, as it happened,
successfully. Ten or twelve ladders were made
so broad and strong that three or four men
might mount them abreast. To all threats
the governor replied he would never surrender
alive, although the religious should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
themselves plant the ladders. The monks
and nuns were then dragged to the heads of
the companies, and forced to plant the ladders,
in spite of the hot rain of fire and shot;
the governor "using his utmost endeavours
to destroy all who came near the walls, firing
on the servants of God, although his kinsmen,
and prisoners, and forced to the service.
Delicate women and aged men were goaded
at the sword's point to this hateful labour,
derided by the English, and unpitied by their
countrymen."</p>

<p>All this time the Buccaneers maintained
an unceasing fire along the whole line of grey
battlements at every aperture where a pike
head glittered or a lighted match smouldered;
suffering much in return, unarmed as they
were, guarded neither by steel-cap nor cuirass,
and unsheltered by palisade or earthwork.
In spite of the cries of the religious as they
reared the ladders, their prayers to the saints,
and their entreaties to the garrison to remember
their common blood and nation,
many of the priests were shot before the
walls could be scaled. The more superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of the Spaniards were unnerved at
hearing the dying curse of the consecrated
servants of God, rising shrill above the roar
of the battle. The ladders were at last
planted, amid a shower of fire-pots that killed
almost as many of the Spaniards as the English,
and the Buccaneers sprang up with all the
agility of sailors and the determination of Berserkers;
their best marksmen shooting down
the few Spaniards who awaited their arrival
at the summit. Their falling bodies struck
a few Buccaneers from their ladders. Every
man that went up carried hand grenades,
pistols, and sabre, but the musket was now
laid aside, for it had done its work, and was
a mere encumbrance in the grapple of closer
combat. The English swarmed up in great
numbers, and reaching the top kindled their
fusees and threw down their fire-pots upon the
crowded ranks of the enemy, with destructive
effect. Before they could recover their dismay,
sabre in hand, as if they were boarding,
they leaped down upon the garrison, who
drove them off with pikes and clubbed
muskets, and, closing with them, hurled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
many from the ramparts, or, stabbing them,
fell clenched with the foe in their despair.
When their cannon was taken, the Spaniards
threw down their arms and begged for quarter,
except the governor and a few officers, who
determined to die fighting against the robbers
and heretics, the enemies of God and Spain.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers, seeing the red flag flying
from the first fort, which was the strongest,
and built on an eminence which commanded
the towers below, advanced with confidence
to the attack of the remaining one, hitherto
thought impregnable, which defended the
port, and prevented the entrance of their
vessels, which they wished to secure safe in
the harbour, as the number of their wounded
would require their long stay in the place
they had captured. The governor, proud
and brave, still refused to surrender, and
fired upon them with his cannon, which were
soon silenced by the superior fire of the
newly-taken fort, which flanked his position.
Out of this last stronghold, the weary and
despairing defenders were quickly driven.</p>

<p>Major Castellon, the stout-hearted governor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
disdaining to ask quarter of a pack of
heretic seamen, killed several of his own men
who would not stand to their arms and called
on him to save their lives, and struck down
many of the hunters who tried to take him
alive, not from a generous compassion, for
pity seldom entered a Buccaneer's heart,
but in order to obtain his ransom. A
still more cruel trial of his courage, and
duty to his king, awaited him: his wife and
children fell at his knees, and, with cries
and tears, begged him to lay down his arms
and save both their lives. But he obstinately
and sternly refused, replying, "Better this
than a scaffold," preferring to die as a
valiant soldier at his post, than to be hanged
as a coward for deserting it. He died the
death of a brave man, fighting desperately,
and was found buried under the bodies of
his dead enemies. If unpitied by his ferocious
foes, he has left a name to be honoured
by all brave men, as one worthy of a more
chivalrous age, and a better cause.</p>

<p>It now being nearly sunset, and the city
their own, the adventurers enclosed all their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
prisoners in the citadel, separating the
wounded, and, although heedless of their
sufferings, employing the female slaves to
wait upon them. It now being nearly night,
they gave way to all the excesses of soldiers
in a town taken by storm, exasperated by
the recollection of past danger, and the
death of friends, and maddened by both the
certainty of present pleasure and the power
of indulging in every success. &#338;xmelin
says, fifty brave Spaniards might have put
all the revellers to death, and recovered the
place. We do not, however, hear that a
single Spanish Jael was found to revenge
herself on these modern Siseras.</p>

<p>The following morning Morgan summoned
his vessels into the harbour, and collecting
all the loose wealth of the town, had it
brought into the fort. Directing the repairs
of the ramparts, scorched and shattered, he
remounted the guns, in order to be ready
to repel any attack from Panama. He collected
a few of the prisoners who had been
persuaded to say they were the richest merchants
in Porto Bello, and put all who would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
not confess to the torture. He maimed some
and killed others, who remained silent because
they were in reality poor, and had concealed
no treasure. Having spent fifteen
days in these alternate cruelties and debaucheries,
Morgan resolved to retreat. No Buccaneer
general had ever taken a city which
could not be stripped clean in fourteen days.
Famine and disease began ungratefully to
take the part of the Spaniard against the
nation that had fed them with so many victims.
Wild waste compelled them already
to devour their mules and horses, rather than
die of hunger, or turn cannibals. Parties of
hunters were sent into the suburbs to hunt
the cattle, whose flesh they then devoured,
saving the mules for the prisoners, who,
between their wounds and their hunger, were
reduced to dreadful extremities.</p>

<p>A death more terrible than that of a blow
in battle now appeared in their midst. Many
had already died victims of excess, and even
the most prudent perished. The bad food,
the sudden transition from excess to want,
and the impurity of the tainted air, produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
a pestilence. The climate of Porto Bello,
always unhealthy, as Hosier's squadron afterwards
experienced, was poisoned by the putrefaction
of the dead bodies, hastily buried,
and scarcely covered by earth. The wounded
nearly all sickened, and the intemperate were
the first to die.</p>

<p>The prisoners, crowded together, and already
weakened mentally by despondency, and
physically by famine, soon caught the fever,
and died with dreadful rapidity. Rich merchants,
accustomed to every luxury, and to the
most varied and seasoned food, pined under a
diet of half-putrid mule's flesh, and bad, unfiltered
water. Everything warned Morgan that
it was time to weigh anchor, for the president
of Panama was already on his march towards
the city at the head of 1500 men. Informed
of their approach from a slave captured
by a hunting party, Morgan held a
council, at which it was agreed not to retreat
until they had obtained a ransom for the town
greater than the spoil at present collected;
and, in order to prevent a surprise, he placed
a body of 100 well-armed men in a narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
defile, where but a few men could go abreast,
and through which the president must pass.
They found that that general had fewer
troops with him than was reported, and these
took flight at the first encounter, and did not
attempt again to force a passage, but waited
for reinforcements. The president, with the
usual gasconade of a Spaniard, sent word to
Morgan, that if he did not at once leave
Porto Bello he should receive no quarter
when he should take him and his companions,
as he hoped soon to do.</p>

<p>To this, Morgan, knowing he had a sure
means of escape, said he should not leave
till he had received 180,000 pieces of eight
as a ransom for the city, and if he could not
get this he should kill all his prisoners, blow
up the castle, and burn the town, and two
men were sent by him to the president to
procure the money.</p>

<p>The president, seeing that nothing could
either deceive or intimidate Morgan, gave up
Porto Bello to its fate, not caring to erect a
silver bridge for a flying enemy. In vain he
sent to Carthagena for a fleet to block up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
ships in the river; in vain he kept the citizens
in suspense as to the money, in hopes of
gaining time. He was deaf and obdurate to
all the entreaties of the citizens, who sent to
inform him that the pirates were not men
but devils, and that they fought with such
fury that the Spanish officers had stabbed
themselves, in very despair, at seeing a supposed
impregnable fortress taken by a handful
of people, when it should have held out
against twice the number.</p>

<p>Don Juan Perez de Guzman, the president,
a man of "great parts," and who had attained
high rank in the war in Flanders,
expressed himself, with candour, as astonished
at the exploits of 400 men (not regular soldiers)
who, with no other arms but their
muskets, had taken a city which any general
in Europe would have found necessary to
have blockaded in due form. He gave the
people of Porto Bello, at the same time, leave
to compound for their safety, but offered
them no aid to insure it.</p>

<p>To Morgan himself he could not refrain
from expressing astonishment. He admired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
his success, with no ordnance for batteries,
and against the citizens of a place who bore
the reputation of being good soldiers, never
wanting courage in their own defence. He
begged, at the same time, that he would send
him some small pattern of the arms wherewith
he had, with such vigour, taken so great
a city. Morgan received the messenger with
great kindness and civility, flattered by the
compliment from an enemy, and glad of an
opportunity of expressing contempt of any
assailants. He took a hunter's musket from
one of his men, and sent it, together with a
handful of Buccaneer bullets, to the president,
begging him to accept it as a small
pattern of the arms wherewith he had taken
Porto Bello, hoping he would keep it a
twelvemonth or two, at which time he hoped
to visit Panama and fetch it away. The
Spaniard, astonished at the wit and civility of
the captain, whom he had deemed a mere
brutal sea thief, sent a messenger to return the
present, as he did not need the loan of weapons,
but thanking Morgan and praising his
courage, remarking at the same time that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
was a pity that such a man should not be
employed in a just war, and in the service of
a great and good prince, and hoping, in conclusion,
that he would not give himself the
trouble of coming to see him at Panama, as
he would not fare there so well as he had
done at Porto Bello. Having delivered this
message, so chivalrous in its tone, the messenger
presented Morgan with a beautiful
gold ring, set with a costly emerald, as a remembrance
of his master Don Guzman, who
had already supplied the English chief with
fresh provisions.</p>

<p>Having now provided himself with all
necessaries, and stripped the unfortunate
city of almost everything but its tiles and
its paving stones, carried off half of the
castle guns and spiked the rest, he then
set sail, taking on board the ransom, which
was punctually paid in the shape of silver
bars. Corn seldom grew where his foot had
once been, and he left behind him famine,
pestilence, poverty, and death. Orphans
and widows, mutilated men and violated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
women leaped for joy as his fleet melted into
the distance.</p>

<p>Setting sail, with great speed, he arrived
in eight days at Cuba, where the spoil was
divided.</p>

<p>They found that they had in gold and
silver, whether in coin or bar, and in
jewels, which from haste and ignorance were
seldom estimated at one-fourth part of their
value, to the value of 260,000 pieces of
eight. This did not include the silks and
merchandise, of which they paid little heed,
only valuing coin or bullion, and regarding
the richest prize without coin as scarce
worth the taking. This division accomplished,
to the general satisfaction of all
but the people of Porto Bello, who were
now poor enough to defy all thieves,
they returned at once to Jamaica, where
they were magnificently received, &#338;xmelin
says, "<i>surtout des cabaretiers</i>." Every door
was open to them, and for a whole week
all loudly praised their generosity and their
courage; at the end of a month, every door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
was shut in their faces, all but one&mdash;the
prison for debts, and that closed behind their
backs. "They spent in a short time," says
one of their historians, "with boundless prodigality,
what they had gained with boundless
danger and unremitting toil." The people
of Tortuga considered them as mere slaves,
who dived to get their pearls, and cared not
whether they perished by the wave or by the
shark, so the pearls which they had gathered
could be first secured.</p>

<p>"Not long after their arrival in Jamaica,"
says Esquemeling, "being that short time
needed to lavish away all their riches, they
concluded on another enterprise to seek new
fortunes:" a sailor spends his money quickly,
and so does a highwayman&mdash;in them both
trades were combined. Morgan remained
at rest as long as most Buccaneers did, that
is to say, till he had drunk out half his
money, strung the jewels of Spanish matrons
around the necks of the fairest courtesans in
Jamaica, and stripped himself at the gambling-table
to-day in the hope of recovering
the losses of yesterday. As his purse grew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
thin his heart grew stout, as his hunger
grew greater his thirst for blood began also
to increase. At last he looked seaward,
turned his back on the lotus-land and the
sirens, and prepared for sea.</p>

<p>His rendezvous this time was fixed in a
small island on the south side of Hispaniola,
in order to invite both the French hunters
and the sailors of Tortuga. By this sign of
confidence Morgan hoped to remove all
rankling prejudice between the French and
English adventurers, and to obtain recruits
from both nations. He resolved this time
upon an expedition which would enable him
and his men to retire from the sea life for
ever, or at least to hold a longer revel.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers of the coast seeing him
always successful, and never returning without
booty, less cruel and less rash than Lolonnois,
and not only very brave but very
fortunate, flocked to his flag almost without
a summons. Every one furbished up his
musket, cast bullets, bought powder, or
fitted up a canoe. Parties were at once
despatched to hunt in the savannahs, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
prepare salted meat sufficient for the voyage.
Great numbers of French and English
crowded to Cow Island.</p>

<p>A powerful ally appeared at this crisis, in
the shape of a French vessel, <i>Le Cerf Volant</i>,
of St. Malo, which had come out to the
Indies, virtuously intending to trade with
the Spaniards, but, finding this difficult or
unprofitable, had less virtuously determined
to live by plundering them, and was now
manned by French adventurers from Tortuga,
no friends to Morgan, but anxious to share
his booty. The vessel, which had also a
long-boat towing at its stern, had a short
time before attacked a Genoese ship, trading
with negroes, but which, mounting forty-eight
cannon, had driven it off, and compelled the
captain to return home and refit. The crew
seemed unwilling to trust the English, and
would not listen to any terms. Morgan, who
had just been joined by a ship from New
England with thirty-six cannon, longed to
add the twenty-four iron guns and the twelve
brass ones of <i>Le Cerf Volant</i> to his collection.
In spite of his wish to unite the two nations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
and close the green and still rankling wound,
the temptation was rather too strong for him.
His guardian angel slept for a moment, and
when she awoke the English flag floated at
the Frenchman's peak.</p>

<p>The change happened thus: the French
captain having refused to join Morgan's expedition,
unless he drew up a peculiar charter
party opposed to all Buccaneer law, and
quarrelling about this, he swore <i>ventre St.
Gris</i>, he would return to Tortuga, reload his
cargo, and return to France.</p>

<p>The blow was to be struck now or never.
The English part of the St. Malo crew had
already deserted to Morgan. Some of these
men furnished him with an opportunity of
revenge. The merchant captain, unaccustomed
to the looseness of Buccaneer discipline,
had treated them as sailors, and not as
<i>matelots</i> and brothers. They told Morgan,
that being short of victual, he had lately
stopped an English vessel, and taken provisions
by force, paying the commander only
with bills of exchange, cashable at Jamaica,
and that he carried secretly a Spanish commission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
empowering him to plunder the
English. These charges, though full of malice,
had a specious appearance of truth.
The captain had indeed stopped an English
vessel, but had paid for all he had taken with
honest bills. He did also carry a Spanish
commission, having been driven to anchor at
the port of Baracoa, on the north-east side
of Cuba, where he had obtained letters of
marque from the governor, in order to conceal
his real errand. Morgan considered this a
sufficient pretext, and sounded his crew to
ascertain how far they would help him at the
moment of need. It was at this very moment
of indecision that the New England
vessel joined the fleet, and enabled him to
bear down any opposition. This ship, which
&#338;xmelin calls the <i>Haktswort</i> (Oxford?)
carried a crew of 300 men. It was said to
belong to the king of England (Charles
II.), and to have been lent by him to the
present captain.</p>

<p>[A strange, improbable story, unless the
English government had really determined to
encourage the Buccaneer movement. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
<i>Haktswort</i> was really sent by the governor
of Jamaica to join the expedition.]</p>

<p>With this timely succour Morgan's mind
was instantly made up. He asked the St.
Malo captain and all his officers to dinner, on
board the newly-arrived vessel, and there
made them prisoners, without any resistance,
away from their crew, and with their ship exposed
to an overwhelming fire. He then affected
the anger of indignant justice, declared
they were robbers, who plundered the English
under a commission from the enemy,
and came there as mere spies and traitors.
Fortunately for him, the English vessel that
had been stopped by the St. Malo crew arrived
at the very moment to repeat and exaggerate
the charge. The ship was now his
own, and only God could take it from him.
And "God did so," says Esquemeling, who
sees a judgment in all misfortunes that befal
an enemy, but none in those that befal his
friends.</p>

<p>Morgan, victorious and exulting, called a
council of war, and summoned all his captains
to attend him on board his large prize. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
praised the vessel, laughed at the tricked
Frenchmen, and discussed their plans. They
calculated what provisions they had in store,
and of what their force was capable. The
island of Savona was agreed upon as a rendezvous,
as at that east corner of Hispaniola
they might lurk and cut off stragglers from
the armed Spanish flota, now daily expected.
Having completed their arrangements they
gave way to pleasure, the real occupation
and business of a Buccaneer's life, his toil
being only expended to procure the means
for pleasure, and time to enjoy it. They
began to feast and drink healths, the officers
below and the sailors on deck. Prayers for
a successful voyage were blended with drunken
songs, and unintelligible blasphemies. The
captain and the cook were both drunk, the
very gunners who discharged a broadside
when the toasts were drained, fell senseless
beside their smoking guns. Those who could
not move slept, those who could walk drank
on. By some accident, a spark from a smoking
match caught the powder, and in an instant
the vessel blew up. In perfect equality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
all ranks were lifted up towards heaven, in
a column of flame, only to fall back again to
perish, burnt and helpless, in the sea. More
than 350 of the 400 men that formed the
crew were drowned. By a singular coincidence,
the officers nearly all escaped. The
English having their powder stored in the
fore part of the vessel, and not in the stern
like the French, the sailors only perished;
the officers and the St. Malo prisoners who
were drinking with them were merely blown,
much bruised, into the water. The English
adventurers, declaring that the French had
set fire to the powder, would have killed
them on the spot, but Morgan, not apparently
the least chapfallen by the disappointment,
sent them all as prisoners to Jamaica. The
thirty men, seated in the great cabin at
some distance from the main force of the
powder, escaped, and many more would have
been saved had they been sober.</p>

<p>The French prisoners in vain endeavoured
to obtain justice in Jamaica, were long detained
in confinement, and threatened with
death when they demanded a trial. Had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Morgan returned unsuccessful they might
have perhaps been listened to.</p>

<p>Eight days after this loss Morgan commanded
his men to collect the floating bodies
now putrifying, not to give them Christian
burial, but to save the clothes, and to remove
the heavy gold rings which the English Buccaneers
wore upon their forefingers, abandoning
their unsaleable bodies to the birds and
to the sharks.</p>

<p>Undaunted by this accident, Morgan
found he had still a force of fifteen vessels,
and 860 men, but his gun ship, the largest of
all, only carried fourteen small guns. They
now made way to Savona, where all were to
repair and careen, and the swift to wait for
the slow. Letters were soon placed in
bottles, and buried at a spot indicated by a
mark agreed on. Coasting Hispaniola, they
were detained by contrary winds, and attempted
for three weeks in vain to double
Cape Lobos. Their provisions ran short, but
they were relieved by an English vessel,
bound to Jamaica, which had a superfluity
for sale.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span></p>

<p>Always seeking for pleasure, though in
emergencies capable of the severest self-denials,
six or seven of the fleet remained
clustering round this vessel to purchase
brandy, as eager and thoughtless as stragglers
round a vivandière. The more thoughtful
and earnest pressed on with Morgan, and,
reaching the bay of Ocoa, waited for them
there, the men spending their time usefully,
as they had agreed before, in hunting, and
foraging for water and provisions, killing some
oxen and a few horses. Detained here by
continued bad weather, Morgan maintained
strict discipline, compelling every captain to
send, daily, on shore eight men from each
ship, making a total force of sixty-four. He
also instituted a convoy, or a body of armed
men, who attended the hunters as a guard,
for they were now near St. Domingo, which
was full of Greek soldiers and Spanish matadors.
The Spaniards, few in number, did
not attack them, but, adopting a Fabian
policy, which suited their pride and phlegm,
sent for 300 or 400 men to kill all the cattle
round the bay. Another party drove all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
herds far into the interior, wishing to starve
the foe out of the island, knowing that a
Buccaneer, pressed by hunger, did not care
whether he ate horse, mule, or ass, falling
back upon monkeys and parrots, and resorting
to sharks' flesh or his own shoes as a
last resource. But when the Buccaneers
spread further inland, a body of soldiers was
despatched to the coast, to practise a stratagem,
and to form an ambuscade.</p>

<p>The following was their plan, which completely
succeeded, but nevertheless ended in
the Spaniards' total rout. A band of fifty
Buccaneers having resolved to venture further
than usual into the woods, a party of
Spanish muleteers were ordered to drive the
bait, a small herd of cattle, past the shore,
where they had landed, pretending to fly
when they caught sight of their enemies.
When they approached the ambuscade two
Spaniards were sent out, carrying a white
flag of truce. The Buccaneers, ceasing the
pursuit, pushed forward two men to parley.</p>

<p>The treacherous Spaniards beseeched them
plaintively not to kill their cows, offering to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
sell them cattle, or furnish them with food.
The Buccaneers, with all the good faith of
seamen, replied that they would give a
crown and a-half for each ox, and that the
seller could make his own profit besides
on the hide and the tallow. During this
time, which was planned to give time for the
operation, the Spanish troops were turning
the flank of the enemy, and had now surrounded
the small band on all sides. They
interrupted the conversation by breaking out
of the wood, with shots and cries of "<i>Mata,
mata</i>"&mdash;"kill, kill," imagining they could cut
to pieces so small a force without a struggle.
The Buccaneers, differing from them in
opinion, faced about with good heart, threw
themselves into a square, and beat a slow
retreat to the forest, keeping up a rolling fire
from all four sides of their brave phalanx.</p>

<p>The Spaniards, considering the retreat a
sure proof of despair and fear, attacked them
with great courage, but great loss. The
Buccaneers losing no men, while the Spaniards
fell thick and fast, cried out, in imprudent
bravado, that they were only trying to frighten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
them, and put no balls in their muskets.
This jest cost them dear, for the Spaniards
had been only aiming high, wishing to kill
them on the spot and to make no prisoners.
They now tried to maim as well as kill, and
soon wounded so many in the legs that the
Buccaneers were obliged to retreat to a
clump of trees, where they stood at bay, and
from whence the Spaniards did not dare to beat
them. They then began to prepare to carry off
their dead and wounded to the vessels, but
seeing a small party of Spaniards piercing
one of the bodies with their swords, they
fired upon them, charged them, and drove
them off, tracking their way by their dead,
and then retreated, killing the cattle and
bearing them off in sorrowful triumph to their
vessels. The very next day, at the first
light, Morgan, furious to revenge this
treachery of the Spaniards, landed himself at
the head of 200 men, and entered the woods,
visiting the scene of the last night's skirmish.
But the Spaniards had long since fled, discovering
that in driving cattle towards the
shore as a lure for the Buccaneer, they only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
brought destruction upon themselves, and a
dangerous enemy nearer to their homes and
treasures. Morgan, finding his search useless,
returned to his ship, having first burned
down all the deserted huts he could find:
"Returning," says Esquemeling, "somewhat
more satisfied in his mind for having done
considerable damage to the enemy, which
was always his ardent desire."</p>

<p>The day after, deciding not to venture an
attack upon Bourg d'Asso, Morgan, impatient
at the delay of his vessels, resolved
to sail without them, and visit Savona,
hoping there to meet his lingering companions.
Alarming the people of St. Domingo,
he coasted round Hispaniola. He
determined to wait eight days at Savona, and,
weary of rest, still wanting provisions, he
sent some boats and 150 men to plunder the
towns round St. Domingo, but they, finding
the Spaniards vigilant and desperate, gave
up the enterprise as hopeless, and returned
empty-handed to endure the curses and sneers
of their commander. Morgan now held a
council of war, for provisions were very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
scanty and time was going. The eight ships
did not arrive, and all agreed, with their
seven small vessels and their 300 men, some
place of importance might still be taken.
Morgan had hitherto resolved to cruise about
the Caraccas and plunder the towns and
villages, mere hen-roost robbing and footpad
work, compared with the enterprise proposed
by one of his French captains amid great
applause.</p>

<p>This captain was Pierre le Picard, the
<i>matelot</i> of the famous Lolonnois when he took
Maracaibo: he it was who had steered the
vessels over the bar, and had served both as
pilot at sea and guide on land; he reefed
and fought, and could handle a rope as well
as a musket. He now proposed a second
attack upon the same place, and, with all the
rude eloquence of sincerity, proved the facility
of the attempt, and the riches that lay within
their reach. As he spoke good English that
could be understood by all, and was, moreover,
much esteemed by Morgan, the scheme
for a new campaign was at once rapturously
approved. He disclosed in the council all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
the entries, passages, forces, and means. A
charter-party was drawn up, containing a
clause, that if the rest of the fleet joined
them before they had taken a fortress, they
should be allowed to share like the rest.</p>

<p>Having left a letter at Savona, buried in
the usual way, the Buccaneers set sail for
Curaçoa, stopping after some days' sail at
the island of Omba, to take in water and
provisions. This place was distant some
twelve leagues from Maracaibo. Here they
stayed twenty-four hours, buying goats of
the natives for hanks of thread and linen.
Sheep, lambs, and kids were the only products
of the island, which abounded with
spiders whose bite produced madness, unless
the sufferer was tied hands and feet, and left
without food for a night and a day. The
fleet set sail in the night, to prevent the
islanders discovering the object of their voyage.</p>

<p>The next morning they sighted the small
islands that lie at the entrance of the lake of
Maracaibo, anchoring out of sight of the
Vigilia, in hopes to escape notice, but were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
observed by the sentries, whose signal gave
the Spaniards ample time for defence. The
fleet remained becalmed, unable to reach the
bar till four o'clock in the afternoon. The
canoes were instantly manned, in order to
take the Bar Fort, rebuilt since Picard's last
visit. Its guns played upon the boats as
they pulled to land. Morgan exhorted his
men to be brave and not to give way&mdash;for he
expected the Spaniards would defend themselves
desperately, seeing their fire was so
rolling and incessant that the fort seemed
like the crater of a small volcano, and
they could now see that the huts round the
wall had been burnt and removed, to leave
them no protection or shelter. "The dispute
continued very hot, being managed with
great courage from morning till dark night."</p>

<p>That latterly the fighting died away to occasional
shots is evident, for, at six o'clock when
it grew dusk, Morgan reconnoitred the fort, and
found it deserted. The cessation of the fire had
already roused their suspicions. Suspecting
treachery, Morgan searched the place to see if
any lighted fuses had been placed near the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
powder, and a division was employed to enter
the place before the main body. There was
no lack of volunteers for this experimental
and cat's-paw work. Morgan himself clambered
up first. As they expected, they found
a lighted match, and a dark train of powder
communicating with the magazine. A little
later and the whole band had perished together.
Morgan himself snatched up the
match. This fort was a redoubt of five toises
high, six long, and three round. In the
magazine they found 3,000 pounds of gunpowder
that would have been wasted had the
place been blown up; fourteen pieces of
cannon, of eight, twelve, and fourteen pounds
calibre, and abundance of fire-pots, hand-grenades,
and carcases; twenty-four muskets
and thirty pikes and bandoliers had been left
by the runaways. The fort was only accessible
by an iron ladder, which could be drawn
up into the guard-room. But courage requires
no ladder, and, like love, can always
find out a way. When they had once
examined the place, the Buccaneers broke
down the parapet, spiked the cannon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
threw them over the walls, and burnt the
gun-carriages.</p>

<p>The Spaniards waited in vain for the roar
of their bursting mine. Their own city was
rocking beneath their feet; a more dreadful
visitation than the earthquake or the hurricane
was at their doors. At daybreak the
fleet sailed up the lake, the ruined fort
smoking behind them. Making great haste,
they arrived at Maracaibo the next day,
having first divided among themselves the
arms and ammunition of the fort. The water
being very low and the shoals numerous, they
disembarked into their boats, with a few
small cannon. From some cavaliers whom
they could see on the walls they believed
that the Spaniards were fortifying themselves.
The Buccaneers therefore landed at some
distance from the town, anchoring and disembarking
amid discharges of their own
cannon, intending to clear the thickets on
the shore. Their men they divided into two
divisions, in order to embarrass the enemy
by a double attack.</p>

<p>But these precautions were useless. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
timid people had already fled into the woods;
only the beggars, who feared no plunderers,
and the sick, who were praying for death,
remained in Maracaibo. The brave fled with
the coward, the monk with the sinner, the
thief from the thieves, the soldiers from
the seamen, the Catholic from the dreaded
Protestant, and the Spaniard from the enemies
of his name and race. The sick were
expecting death, and cared not if it came by
the hand of the doctor or the Buccaneer;
the beggar hoped to benefit by those who
could not covet, and might pity, their rags.
"A few miserable folk, who had nothing to
lose," says Esquemeling, "alone remained."
Crippled slaves, not worth removing, lay in
the streets; the dying groaned untended in
the hospital. Children fled from parents, and
parents from children; rich old age was left
to die in spite of all the inducements of
avarice. The prostitute fled to escape dishonour,
and the murderer to avoid bloodshed.</p>

<p>The houses were empty, the doors open,
the chambers stripped of every movable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
costly or precious. The first care of the
invaders was to search every corner for
prisoners, the next to secure, each party as
they arrived, the richest palaces for their
barracks. The palaces were their dens, the
churches their prisons; everything they defiled
and polluted, the loathsome things they
made still more horrible, the holy they in
some degree contaminated. At sea they
were brave, obedient, self-denying, religious
in formula (half the world goes no further),
determined, and irresistible; on land cruel,
bloody, rebellious, and ferocious. At sea
they exceeded most men in the practice of
the sterner virtues, on land they were demons
of wrath, devils of drunkenness and lust,
mercenaries and outlaws in their bearing and
their actions. The three former days of
terror had sapped the courage of the bravest,
and alarm and fear had, by a common panic,
induced the inhabitants to hide the merchandise
in the woods. The men who fled
had had fathers and children killed and tortured
in the first expedition. Friends, still
maimed by the rack, increased their fears by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
their narrations. The Buccaneers seemed a
judgment from God, irresistible and unavertable.
The desire to defend riches seems to
be a weaker principle in the human mind
than the desire to obtain them. Great conquerors
have generally been poorer than the
nations they have conquered.</p>

<p>Scarcely any provisions remained in the
town. There was no vessel or boat in the
port, all had been removed into the wide lake
beyond. The small demilune fort, with its
four cannon, that was intended to guard the
harbour, was also deserted. The richer the
man, the further he had escaped inland; the
needy were in the woods, the drunken beggars
revelled alone in the town, rejoicing in an
event that at least made them rich: "It is an
ill wind that blows nobody good."</p>

<p>The very same day the Buccaneers despatched
a body of 100 men to search the woods
for refugees, any attempt to secrete treasure
being a heavy offence in the eyes of Morgan.
These men returned the next evening
with thirty prisoners, fifty mules, and several
horses laden with baggage and rich merchandise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Both the male and female prisoners
seemed poor and worthless. They were immediately
tortured, in order to induce them
to disclose where their richer and more
virtuous fellow citizens were hidden. Morgan,
finding none to resist him, quartered his
men in the richest houses, selecting the
church as their central guard-house and
rallying point, their store-room for plunder,
their court of justice (blind and with false
weights), and their torture-chamber.</p>

<p>Some of the prisoners offered to act as
guides to places where they knew money and
jewels were hidden. As several places were
named, two parties went out the same night
upon this exciting search. The one party
returned on the morrow with much booty,
the other did not wander in for two days,
having been misled by a prisoner, who, in
the hopes of finding means to escape through
his knowledge of the country, had led them
into such dangerous and uninhabited places
that they had had a thousand difficulties in
avoiding. Furious at finding themselves
mocked by their guide, they hung him on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
tree without any parley. In returning they
came, however, suddenly upon some slaves
who were seeking for food by night, having
been hiding in the woods all day. Torture
was at once resorted to, to find out where
the masters lay, for slaves could not be there
alone. The braver of the two suffered the
most horrible pain without disclosing a syllable,
and was eventually cut to pieces without
confessing; the weaker, and perhaps
younger negro, endured his sufferings at first
with equal fortitude, although he was offered
liberty and reward if he would speak. But
when the seamen drew their sabres, still red
with the blood of his companion, and began
to hew and gash his brother's limbs that
still lay palpitating on the ground, his
courage fell, and he offered to lead them to
his master. The Spaniard was soon taken
with 30,000 crowns' worth of plate.</p>

<p>For eight days the men practised unheard-of
cruelties upon the wretched townsmen,
already starved and beggared, wretches whose
only crime had been their yielding to the
natural impulse of self-preservation. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
hung them up by their beards and by the
hair of their heads, by an arm or a leg; they
stretched their limbs tight with cords, and
then beat with rattans upon the rigid flesh;
they placed burning matches between their
fingers; they twisted cords about their heads,
tightening the strain by the leverage of their
pistol stocks, till the eyes sprang from the
sockets. The deathblow was never given
from pity, but as the climax and consummation
of suffering, and when the executioners
were weary of their cruelty. In vain the
tortured Spaniards screamed that the treasure
was all removed to Gibraltar, and that they
were not the rich citizens but very poor men,
monks and servants of Jesus, God help them!
Many died before the rack could be loosened.</p>

<p>Captain Picard, exulting in the success of
his expedition, was now very urgent in
pressing Morgan to advance on Gibraltar
before succours could arrive there from Merida,
believing that it would surrender as it
had done to Lolonnois. Morgan having in
his custody about 100 of the chief families of
Maracaibo, and all the accessible booty, embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
eight days after his landing, and
proceeded to Gibraltar, hoping to rival Lolonnois
in every virtue. His prisoners and
plunder went with him, and he determined
to hazard a battle. Expecting an obstinate
defence, every Buccaneer made his will, consoling
himself by the thought of revelry at
Jamaica if he was one of those lucky enough
to escape. "Death," says &#338;xmelin, "was
never much mixed up in their thoughts,
especially when there was booty in view, for
if there were only some hopes of plunder they
would fight like lions." Before the fleet
started, two prisoners had been sent to
Gibraltar to warn the governor that Captain
Morgan would give him no quarter if he did
not surrender.</p>

<p>Picard, who remembered the former dangerous
spots, made his men land about a
quarter of a league from the town, and march
through the woods in hopes of taking the
Spaniards in the rear, in case they should be
again entrenched. The enemy received them
with quick discharges of cannon, but the
men cheered each other, saying, "We must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
make a breakfast of these bitter things ere
we sup on the sweetmeats of Gibraltar."
They landed early in the morning, and
found no more difficulty than at Maracaibo.
The Spaniards, deceived by a stratagem, had
expected their approach by the road, and not
by the woods. They had no time to throw
up entrenchments, and only a few barricades,
planted with cannon, protected their flight.
They remembered Lolonnois; their hearts
became as water, and they fled as the Buccaneers
took peaceable possession of the town.
The Spaniards took with them their riches,
and all their ammunition, to use at some more
convenient period. Morgan, rejoicing in
the easy victory, posted his men at the
strong points of the town, while 100 men,
under Picard, went out to pursue and bring
in prisoners. They found the guns spiked,
and every house sacked by its owner, much
spoiled, much carried off, and the heavy and
the worthless alone left.</p>

<p>The only inhabitant remaining in the
town was a poor half-witted Spaniard, who
had not clearly ascertained what he ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
do. He was so well dressed that they at
first took him, much to his delight, for a man
of rank, and asked him what had become of
all the people of Gibraltar. He replied, "they
had been gone a day, but he did not know
where; he had not asked, but he dare say
they would soon be back, and for his part
he, Pepé, did not care." When they inquired
where the sugar-mills were, he replied
that he had never seen any in his life. The
church money, he knew, was hid in the
sacristy of the great church. Taking them
there he showed them a large coffer, where he
pretended to have seen it hid. They opened
it and found it empty. To all other inquiries
he now answered, "I know nothing, I know
nothing." Some of the Buccaneers, angry
at the disappointment, and vexed at the
subtlety of the Spaniards, declared the fellow
was more knave than fool, and dragged him to
torture. They gave him first the strapado, till
he began to wish the people were returned;
they then hung him up for two hours with
heavy stones tied to his feet, till his arms
were dislocated. At last he cried out, "Do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
plague me any more, but come with me and
I will show you my goods and my riches."
He then led them to a miserable hovel, containing
only a few earthen pots and three
pieces of eight, wrapped in faded finery,
buried under the hearth. He then said his
name was Don Sebastian Sanchez, brother of
the governor of Maracaibo, that he was
worth more than 50,000 crowns, and that he
would write for it and give it up if they
would cease to hang and plague him so.
They then tortured him again, thinking he
was a grandee in disguise, till he offered, if
he was released, to show them a refinery.
They had not got a musket-shot from the hut
before he fell on his knees and gave himself
up as a criminal. "Jesu Maria!" he cried,
"what will you do with me, Englishmen? I
am a poor man who live on alms, and sleep in
the hospital." They then lit palm-leaves
and scorched him, and would have burnt off
all his clothes had he not been released by
one of the Buccaneers who now saw he was
an idiot. The poor fellow died in great
torment in about half-an-hour, and before he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
grew cold was dragged into the woods and
buried.</p>

<p>The following day Picard brought in an
old peasant and his two daughters; the old
man, his crippled limbs having been tortured,
offered to serve as guide, and lead them to
some houses in the suburbs. Half blind and
frightened, he mistook his way, and the Buccaneers,
thinking the error intentional, made
a slave, who declared he had intentionally
misled them, hang him on a tree by the
road side.</p>

<p>Slavery here brought its own retribution,
for this same slave, burning to avenge some
ill treatment he had received, offered, on
being made free, to lead them to many of the
Spanish places of refuge. Before evening ten
or twelve families, with all their wealth, were
brought into Gibraltar. It had now become
difficult to track the fugitives, as fathers
refused even to trust their children; no one
slept twice in the same spot, for fear that
some one who knew of the retreat would be
captured, and then, under torture, betray the
spot, generally huts in the darkest recesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
of the woods, where their goods were stored
from the weather. These exiles were, however,
obliged to steal at night to their country houses
to obtain food, and then they were intercepted.
From some of these merchants Morgan
heard that a vessel of 100 tons, and three
barges laden with silver and merchandise
belonging to Maracaibo, now lay in the river;
about six leagues distant, and 100 men were
despatched to secure the prize.</p>

<p>In scouring the woods again with a body
of 200 human bloodhounds, Morgan surprised
a large body of Spaniards. Some of these he
forced the negro guide to kill before the eyes
of the others, in order to implicate him in
the eyes of the survivors. After eight days'
search the band returned with 250 prisoners,
and a long train of baggage mules, bound for
Merida. The prisoners were each separately
examined as to where the treasure was hid.
Those who would not confess, and even those
who had nothing to confess, were tortured to
death&mdash;burnt, maimed, or had their life
slowly crushed out of them.</p>

<p>Amongst the greatest sufferers in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
purgatory on earth was an old Portuguese of
venerable appearance, perhaps either a miser
or purposely disguised. This man the blood-thirsty
negro, now high in favour with the
Buccaneers, and trying to rival them in
cruelty, declared was very rich. The poor
old man, tearing his thin grey hair, swore by
the Virgin and all the saints that he had but
100 pieces of eight in the whole world, and
these had been stolen from him a few days
before, during the general chaos, by a runaway
slave. This he vowed on his knees
with tears and prayers, doubly vehement
when coming from one already on the grave's
brink. The cruel slave still looked sneeringly
on, and swore he was known to be the richest
merchant in all Gibraltar. The Buccaneers
then stretched the Portuguese with cords till
both his arms broke at the shoulder, and
then bound him by the hands and feet to the
four corners of a room, placing upon his loins
a stone, weighing five cwt., while four men,
laughing at his cries, kept the cords that
tied him in perpetual motion. This inhuman
punishment they called "swimming on land."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
As he still refused to speak, they held fire
under him as he swung groaning, burnt
off his beard and moustaches, and then left
him hanging while they strapadoed another.
The next man they threw into a ditch, after
having pierced him with many sword thrusts,
for they seem to have been as insatiable for
variety of cruelty as they were for cruelty
itself. They left him for dead, but he
crawled home, and eventually recovered,
although several sword blades had passed
completely through his body.</p>

<p>As for the old Portuguese, his sufferings were
far from ended; putting him on a mule they
brought him into Gibraltar, and imprisoned
him in the church, binding him to a pillar
apart from the rest, supplying him with food
barely sufficient to enable him to endure his
tortures. Four or five days having passed, he
entreated that a certain fellow prisoner, whom
he named, might be brought to him. This
request being complied with, as the first
step to obtaining a ransom while he still
remained alive, he offered them, through
this agent, a sum of 500 pieces of eight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
But the Buccaneers laughed at so small a
sum, and fell upon him with clubs, crying
"500,000, old hunx, and not 500, or you
shall not live." After several more days of
continued suffering, during which he incessantly
protested that he was a poor man and
kept a small tavern, the miser confessed that
he had a store of 2000 pieces of eight, buried
in an earthen jar, and all these, bruised and
mutilated as he was and much as he loved
money, he gave for his liberty, and a few
days more of life.</p>

<p>Upon the other prisoners, without regard
to age, sex, or rank, they inflicted tortures
too disgusting and shocking to mention. Fear,
hatred, and avarice generated crimes, till the
prisoners grew as vile as their persecutors.</p>

<p>A slave, who had been cruelly treated by
his master, persuaded the Buccaneers to
torture him on the plea that he was very
rich, although he was in reality a man of no
wealth. The other prisoners, roused from
the selfishness of self-preservation by a thrill
of involuntary compassion, told Morgan that
the Spaniard was a poor man, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
slave had perjured himself to obtain revenge.
Morgan released the Spaniard directly, but
he had been already tortured. The slave
was given up to his master to be punished
by any sort of death he chose to inflict.
Handed over to the Buccaneers, he was
chopped to pieces in his master's presence,
still exulting in his revenge. "This," says
&#338;xmelin, with a cold <i>naïveté</i>, "satisfait
l'Espagnol, quoyqu'il fust fort mal traité, et
en danger d'estre estropié" (this satisfied the
Spaniard, though he had been very badly
treated, and almost lamed for life). Some of
the prisoners were crucified, others were burnt
with matches tied between their toes or
fingers, many had their feet forced into the
fires till they dropped from the leg black and
charred. All that the Indians had suffered
was now retaliated on the Spaniards. The
Buccaneers themselves considered the punishment
a vengeance of Providence. The only
mercy ever shown to a Spaniard was to end
his sufferings by death. The <i>coup de grace</i>
was a kindness when it ended the misery of
a groaning wretch, bruised and burnt, lying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
in the hot sun, half mortified, or with his
body already paralyzed four or five days since.
The masters being all tortured, the slaves
next received the strapado. These men,
weaker in their moral nature and with no
motive for concealment but fear, told everything.
Many of the hiding-places were, however,
not known to them. One of them,
during the fever of his wound, declared he
knew where the governor of the town was
secreted, with many of the ladies of Gibraltar,
and a large portion of the treasure.
Threats of death revealed the rest, and he
confessed that a ship and four boats, laden
with Maracaibo wealth, lay in a river of the
lake. The Buccaneers were instantly on
their feet. Morgan, with 200 men and the
slave guide, set out to capture the governor;
and 100 others, in two large <i>settees</i> (boats),
sallied out to capture the treasure and the
ships. The governor was not easily caught,
for it needed a battalion of balloons to surprise
him. His first retreat was a fort thrown
up in the centre of a small island in the river,
two days' march distant. Hearing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Morgan was coming in force, he retreated to
the top of an adjoining mountain, into which
there was but one ascent, so straight, narrow,
and perilous, that it could only be mounted
in single file.</p>

<p>The expedition altogether broke down,
the rock proved inaccessible to any but
eagles; a "huge rain" wetted their baggage
and ammunition; in fording a river
swollen by this "huge rain," many of their
female prisoners were lost, and, what they
valued more, several mules laden with plate
were whirled down the torrents. Many of
the women and children sank under the
fatigue, and some escaped. Involved in a
marshy country, up to their middles in water,
the Buccaneers had to toil on for miles. A
few lost their lives, others their arms (the
means of preserving them). A body of fifty
determined men, the Buccaneer historian
himself says, could have destroyed the whole
body. But the Spaniards were already so
paralyzed by fear that they fled at the very
rustle of a leaf. Twelve days were spent in
this dangerous and useless expedition. Two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
days after them arrived their comrades, who
had been somewhat more successful. The
Spaniards had unloaded the vessels, and were
beginning to burn them when they arrived,
but many bales were left in the haste of
flight, and the boats, full of plunder, were
brought away in tow.</p>

<p>Morgan had now been lord in Gibraltar
for five whole weeks, practising all insolences
that a conqueror ever inflicts on the conquered;
revenging on them the sufferings of
the conquest, and trampling them under foot
for the very pleasure of destruction. Provisions
now failing, he resolved to depart; the
provisions of Gibraltar, except the fruits,
coming entirely from Maracaibo, were delayed
and intercepted. He first sent some
prisoners into the woods to collect a ransom
from the fugitives, under pain of again burning
down their newly rebuilt city. He
demanded 5,000 pieces of eight. They promised
to pay it in eight days, and gave four
of their richest citizens as hostages. The
governor, safe from all danger himself, had,
however, forbidden them to pay any ransom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and they prayed Morgan to have patience.</p>

<p>Setting sail with his hostages he arrived
in three days at Maracaibo, afraid that, during
his long absence, the Spaniards had fortified
themselves, and he should have to fight his
way through the passes. Before his departure
he released all his prisoners who had
paid ransom, but detained the slaves. He
refused particularly to give up the treacherous
negro, because he knew they would
burn him alive.</p>

<p>The only inmate of all the rich palaces
and wide squares of Maracaibo, was a poor
sick man, who informed him (Morgan), to his
astonishment, that three Spanish men-of-war
had arrived at the bar, and had repaired and
garrisoned the fort. Their commander was
Don Alonso del Campo d'Espinosa, the vice-admiral
of the Indian fleet, who had been
despatched to those seas to protect the
Spanish colonists, and put to the sword
every adventurer he could meet. This news
did not alarm those who every day "set their
lives upon the hazard of a die," but it
enraged men who thought themselves secure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of their plunder, and which they now might
have to throw off to lighten them in their
retreat. Morgan instantly despatched his
swiftest vessel to reconnoitre the bar. The
men returned next day, assuring him that the
story was too true, and they were in very
imminent danger. They had approached so
near as to be in peril of the shot, the
biggest ship mounted forty guns, the next
thirty, and the smallest twenty, while Morgan's
flag-ship had only fourteen. They had
seen the flag of Castile waving on the redoubt.
There was no means of escape by
sea or land, and all were in despair at such
enemies so placed.</p>

<p>Morgan, undaunted and roused to new
courage by the extremity, grew more full of
audacity than ever. He at once sent a flag
of truce to the <i>Magdalene</i>, the Spanish admiral's
vessel, demanding 20,000 pieces of eight,
or he should set Maracaibo in flames. The
admiral, amused and astonished at such
temerity, wrote back to say, that hearing
that they had committed hostilities in the
dominions of his Catholic Majesty, his sovereign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
lord and master, he had come to
dispute their passage out of the lake, from
that castle, which they had taken out of the
hands of a parcel of cowards, and he intended
to follow and pursue them everywhere, as
was his duty. The letter continued: "Notwithstanding
if you be contented to surrender
with humility all you have taken, together
with the slaves and other prisoners, I will let
you pass freely without trouble or molestation,
on condition that you retire home presently
to your own country. But if you make any
resistance or opposition to what I offer you, I
assure you I will command boats to come from
the Caraccas, wherein I will put my troops,
and, coming to Maracaibo, will put you every
man to the sword. This is my last and
absolute resolution; be prudent, therefore,
and do not abuse my bounty with ingratitude.
I have with me very good soldiers, who
desire nothing more ardently than to revenge
on you and your people all the cruelties and
base infamous actions you have committed
upon the Spanish nation in America."</p>

<p>This vapouring letter Morgan read aloud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
to his men in the broad market-place at
Maracaibo, first in French and then in English,
begging their advice on the whole
matter&mdash;asking them whether they would
surrender everything for liberty, or fight for
both liberty and hard-won treasure. They all
answered unanimously, they did not care for
the Spanish brag, and they would rather fight
to the last drop of their blood than surrender
booty got with such peril. One of the men,
stepping forward, cried, "You take care of
the rest, I'll build a <i>brûlot</i>, and with twelve
men will burn the biggest of the three
Spaniards."</p>

<p>The scheme was adopted, but resolved
once more to try negotiation, now that he
was prepared for the worst, Morgan wrote
again to Don Alonso, offering to leave Maracaibo
uninjured, surrender all the prisoners,
half the slaves, and to give up the hostages.
The Don, trusting in his superior strength,
and believing Morgan fairly intimidated or
at least entirely in his mercy, refused to
listen to any terms but those he had proposed,
adding, that in two days he should come and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
force him to yield. Morgan resolved upon
this to fight his way out and surrender
nothing, his men, though discouraged, being
still brave and desperate. All things were
put in order to fight. The Englishman of
Morgan's crew proceeded as fast as possible
with his <i>brûlot</i>, or fire-ship. He took the
small vessel captured in the Rivière des
Espines, and filled it full of palm-leaves dipped
in tar, and a mixture of brimstone and gunpowder.
He put several pounds of powder
under each of the ten sham guns, which
were formed of negro drums. The partitions
of the cabins were then broken down, so that
the flame might spread unimpeded. The
crew were wooden posts, dressed up with
swords, muskets, bandoliers, and hats or
montero caps. This fire-ship bore the English
colours, so that it might pass for Morgan's
vessel; and in eight days, by all hands
working upon it, it was ready. During the
preparation an extra guard was kept upon
the prisoners, for one escaping would have
destroyed all their hopes of safety. The
male prisoners were kept in one boat, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the females, slaves, plate, and jewels in another.
In others, guarded by twelve men
each, came the merchandise. The <i>brûlot</i> was
to go first and grapple with the admiral's
ship.</p>

<p>All things being now completed, Morgan,
with a heart as gay as if he fought for God and
the right, made his men take the usual Buccaneer
oath, employed on all occasions of
pressing danger, when mutual confidence
was peculiarly necessary. They vowed to
fight till death, and neither to give nor take
quarter. He promised a reward to all who
distinguished themselves, exciting all the
strongest feelings of their nature&mdash;revenge,
avarice, and self-preservation.</p>

<p>With these desperate resolves, full of hope,
for they were accustomed to consider his
promises of victory as certain prophecies,
they set sail on the 30th day of April, 1669,
to seek the Spaniards.</p>

<p>They found the Spanish fleet riding at
anchor in the middle of the entry of the
lake, like gaolers of their spacious prison. It
being late and almost dark, Morgan gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
orders to anchor within range of the enemy,
determined to resist if attacked, but to wait
for light. They kept a strict watch, and at
daybreak lifted anchor and set sail, bearing
down straight upon the Spaniards, who,
seeing them move, advanced to meet them.</p>

<p>Poor fishing boats the Buccaneers' barks
seemed beneath those proud floating castles;
"but the race is not always to the swift, nor
the battle to the strong." The <i>brûlot</i> sailed
first, pushing on to the admiral's vessel,
which lay stately between its two companions,
and was suffered to approach within cannon
shot. The Spaniards believing that it was
Morgan's vessel, and intended to board them,
waited till it came closer to crush it with a
broadside. They little thought that they
were fighting with the elements. The fire-ship
fell upon the Spaniard and clung to its
sides, like a wild cat on an elephant. Too
late the Spaniard attempted to push her off,
but the flames had already leaped from their
lurking places; first the sails were swathed
in fire, then the tackling shrivelled up, and
soon the solid timbers burst into a blaze.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
The stern was first consumed, and the fore
part sank hissing into the sea. The wretched
crew, flying from one element to the other,
perished, some by fire, some by water; the
half-drowning clung to the burning planks
and withered in the glare; the burning
sailors were sucked down by the vortex of
the sinking wreck. Don Alonso, seeing the
danger, called out to them in vain to cut down
the masts, and, throwing himself with difficulty
into his sloop, escaped to land. The sailors,
refusing quarter, were allowed to perish by
the Buccaneers' boats' crews, who at first
offered to save them. Perhaps the recollection
of their oath lessened their exertions.</p>

<p>The boats were pulling round the burning
vessel in hopes of saving plunder, and not of
saving lives. The second vessel was boarded
by the Buccaneers and taken, in the confusion,
almost without resistance. The third ship,
cutting its cables, drifted towards the fort,
and there ran ashore, the crew setting fire to
her to prevent capture. The Buccaneers,
proud of their victory, determined to push it
to extremities by landing and attempting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
storm the fort at the bar, without ladders,
and relying only on their hand grenades, but
their artillery was too small to make any
practicable breach. The fort they found well
supplied with men, cannon, and ammunition.
The garrison had not suffered personally by
the loss of a fleet manned by strangers,
and they repulsed all attacks. Unwilling to
retire, Morgan spent the whole of the day till
dusk in firing muskets at any defenders who
showed themselves above the walls, and at
dusk lit them up with a shower of fireballs,
but the Spaniards desperately resisted, and
shot so furiously at them as to drive them
back to the ships, with the loss of thirty
killed and as many wounded&mdash;more loss than
they had suffered in the capture of Maracaibo
and Gibraltar, while the fleet had been
destroyed without the loss of a single
man. The garrison, expecting a fresh
attack at daybreak, laboured all night
to strengthen their works, levelling the
ground towards the sea, and throwing up
entrenchments from spots that commanded
the castle.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>The next day Morgan, not intending to
renew the attack, employed himself in saving
the Spanish sailors who were still floating on
charred pieces of the wreck; not rescuing
them from mercy, but in order to make them
help in recovering part of the sunk treasure.
They acknowledged that Don Alonso had
compelled them before the engagement, after
they had confessed to the chaplain, to come
and take an oath to give the enemy no
quarter, which was the reason many had
refused to be saved. The admiral's vessel,
the <i>Magdalene</i>, had carried thirty-eight guns
and twelve small brass pieces, and was
manned by 350 sailors; the second, the <i>St.
Louis</i>, had thirty-four guns and 200 men; and
the third, the <i>Marquise</i>, twenty-two guns
and 150 men. The <i>Marquise</i> derived its
name from the Marquis de Coquin, who had
fitted it out as a privateer. The <i>Concepcion</i>
and <i>Nostra Signora de la Soledad</i>, two larger
vessels, had been sent back to Spain from
Carthagena; a fourth, <i>Nostra Signora del
Carmen</i> (for the Spaniards generally drew
the names of their war vessels from the lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of love and peace), had sunk near Campeachy.</p>

<p>The pilot of the smaller vessel being saved,
and promised his life, disclosed all Don
Alonso's plans. He had been sent, upon the
tidings of the loss of Porto Bello, by direction
of the supreme council of state, with orders
to root out the English pirates in those parts,
and to destroy as many as he could, for dismal
lamentations had been made to the court of
Spain, to the Catholic king, to whom belonged
the care and preservation of the New
World, of the damages and hostilities committed
by the English, and he had resolved
to punish these proceedings and avenge his
subjects. The king of England being complained
to, constantly replied that he never
gave any letters-patent to such men or such
ships. Sending home his more cumbrous
ships, the Don had heard at St. Domingo of
the fleet sailing from Jamaica, and a prisoner,
taken at Alta Grecia, disclosed Morgan's plan
on the Caraccas. On arriving there the wild
fire had already broken out at Maracaibo a
second time, and hither he came to extinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
it. A negro slave had indeed
informed the admiral of the fire-ship, but
with short-sighted pride he derided the idea,
saying that the English had had neither wit,
tools, nor time to build it.</p>

<p>The pilot who made these disclosures was
rewarded by Morgan, and, yielding to his
promises, entered into his service. He informed
him, with the usual zeal of a deserter,
that there was plate to the value of 40,000
pieces of eight in the sunken ship, for he
had seen it brought on board in boats. The
divers eventually recovered 2000 pounds'
worth of it, some "in plate" and others in
piastres, that had melted into large lumps,
together with many silver hilts of swords and
other valuables.</p>

<p>Leaving a vessel to superintend this profitable
fishery, Morgan hurried back to Maracaibo,
and, fitting up his largest prize for
himself, gave his own ship to a companion.
He also sent to the governor, now somewhat
crest-fallen, to re-demand the ransom, threatening
more violently than before to burn
down the city in eight days if it was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
brought in. He also demanded, in addition,
500 cows as victual for his fleet. These were
brought in in the short space of two days,
with part of the money, and eleven more days
were spent in salting the meat and preparing
for sea. Then returning to the mouth of
the lake, he sent to Don Alonso to demand
a free passage, offering to send all
the prisoners on shore as soon as he had
once passed out, but otherwise to tie the
prisoners to the rigging, exposing them to
the shot of the fort, and then to kill and
throw overboard those who were not struck.
The prisoners also sent a petition, praying
the governor to spare their lives. But the
Don, quite undaunted, sternly answered to
the hostages, who besought him on their
knees to save them from the sword and rope,
"If you had been as loyal to your king
in hindering the entry of these pirates as I
shall be in hindering their going out, you
had never caused these troubles, either to
yourselves or to our whole nation, which
hath suffered so much through your pusillanimity.
I shall not grant your request, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
shall endeavour to maintain that respect
which is due to my king, according to my
duty."</p>

<p>When the terrified messengers returned
and told Morgan, he replied, "If Alonso will
not let me pass, I will find out a way without
him," resolving to use either force or
stratagem, and perhaps both.</p>

<p>Fearing that a storm might separate his fleet,
or that some might not succeed in escaping,
Morgan divided the booty before he attempted
to pass the bar. Having all taken
the usual oath, he found they had collected
250,000 pieces of eight, including money
and jewels, and in addition a vast bulk of
merchandise and many slaves. Eight days
were spent in this division, which took place
within sight of the exasperated garrison in
the fort.</p>

<p>The following stratagem was then resorted
to. Knowing that the Spaniards were expecting
a final and desperate attack on the day
before their departure, the Buccaneers made
great show of preparing to land and attack
the fort. Part of each ship's crew embarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
with their colours in their canoes,
which were instantly rowed to shore. Here
the men, concealed by the boughs on the
banks, lay down flat in their boats, and were
rowed back again to their vessels by only
two or three sailors. This feigned landing
they repeated several times in the day. The
Spaniards, certain of an escalade, at night
brought down the great eighteen pound ship
guns of the fort to the side of the island
looking towards the land, and left the sea-shore
almost defenceless. When night came
Morgan weighed anchor, and, by moonlight
setting sail, at the commencement of the ebb
tide, dropped gently down the river, till the
vessels were almost alongside of the castle.
Then spreading sails, quick as magic, he
drove past, firmly but warily. Every precaution
was taken. The crew were couched
flat on the poop, and some placed below to
plug the shot-holes as they came. The
Spaniards, astonished at their daring, and
enraged at their escape, ran with all speed
and shifted their battery, firing hastily,
furiously, and with little certainty; but by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
this time, a favourable wind springing up,
the Buccaneers were almost out of reach, few
men were killed, and little damage done.</p>

<p>In this manner escaped Morgan from the
clutches of Don Alonso, who had thought himself
sure of his prey. The baffled rage of the
Spaniards and the wild joy of the Buccaneers,
their clamorous approval of Morgan's skill,
the exultation of their triumph, and the
prisoners' dismay, may be easily imagined.
Generous in success, Morgan, once out of
range of the guns that thundered in pursuit,
sent a canoe on shore with his prisoners from
Maracaibo, but those of Gibraltar he carried off,
as they had not yet paid their ransom. The
joy of one and the grief of the other, their
parting and the tears, were painful to witness.
As he set sail, and the fort was still looming
to the right, Morgan discharged a farewell
salute of eight guns, to which the chapfallen
Spaniards had not the heart to return even a
single musket shot.</p>

<p>But out of Scylla into Charybdis was a
Buccaneer's fate: one danger was succeeded
by another, hope by hope, despair by despair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
The very day of their escape the judgment
of Heaven seemed to overtake the sea rovers,
as if to warn them that no stratagems could
defeat God. The fleet was surprised by such
a tempest that they were compelled to anchor
in five or six fathom water. The storm
increased, they were obliged to weigh
again, and at any risk keep off the land.
Their only choice seemed to be death by the
Spaniard, the Indian, or the wave&mdash;all equally
hostile and deaf to mercy.</p>

<p>&#338;xmelin says he was on board the least
seaworthy vessel of the whole fleet, that,
having lost anchors and mainsail, they had
great difficulty in keeping afloat, and were
obliged to bale as well as work night and
day at the pumps, amid deafening thunder
and mountainous seas that threatened to
drown them even while the vessel still floated.
The ship, but for the ropes that held it together,
would have instantly sunk. The
lightning and the wave disputed for their
prey, but the rude arbiter, the wind, came
in and snatched them from these destroyers.
"Indeed," says &#338;xmelin, "though worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
out with fatigue and toil, we could not make
up our minds to close our eyes on that blessed
light which we might so soon lose sight of
for ever, for no hope of safety now remained.
The storm had lasted four days, and there
was no probability of its termination. On
one side we saw rocks on which our vessel
threatened every instant to drive, on the
other were Indians who would no more
have spared us than the Spaniards who were
behind us; and by some evil fortune the
wind drove us ceaselessly towards the rocks
and the Indians, and away from the place
whither we desired to go."</p>

<p>In the midst of these distresses, six armed
vessels gave them chase through the storm
when they were near the bay of Venezuela.
They turned out to be vessels of the Count
d'Estreés, the French admiral, who generously
rendered them aid, and the wind
abating enabled them to reach the shore.
Morgan and some others made for Jamaica,
and the French for St. Domingo,&mdash;the
Spaniards at the fort probably believing
they had perished in the gale.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<p>The laggers of Morgan's fleet, who had
never joined him, were less fortunate than
the admiral they deserted. 400 in number,
they landed at Savona, but could not find
the buried letter. They determined to attack
the town of Comana, on the Caraccas,
choosing Captain Hansel, who had distinguished
himself at Porto Bello, as their
commander. This town was distant sixty
leagues from Trinidad. On landing they
killed a few Indians who awaited them on
the beach, but the Spaniards, disputing
briskly the entry of the town, drove them
back at last to their ships with great loss
and confusion. On returning to Jamaica
they were jeered at by Morgan's men, who
used to say, "Let us see what sort of money
you brought from Comana, and if it be as
good as that which we won at Maracaibo."</p>

<p>Morgan, encouraged by success, soon determined
on fresh enterprises. On arriving
at Jamaica, "he found many of his officers
and soldiers already reduced to their former
indigency by their vices and debaucheries.
Hence they perpetually importuned him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
new exploits, thereby to get something to
expend still in wine and strumpets, as they
had already done what they got before.
Captain Morgan, willing to follow fortune's
call, stopped the mouths of many inhabitants
of Jamaica who were creditors to his men
for large sums, with the hopes and promises
of greater achievements than ever in a new
expedition. This done, he could easily levy
men for any enterprise, his name being so
famous through all these islands, as that
alone would readily bring him in more men
than he could well employ."</p>

<p>Affecting a mystery, attractive in itself,
and necessary where Spanish spies might be
present, Morgan appointed a rendezvous at
Port Couillon, on the south side of Hispaniola,
and made known his intentions to the English
and French adventurers, whether in
Tortuga or St. Domingo. He wrote letters
to all the planters and old Buccaneers in
Hispaniola, and desired their attendance at
a common council. At many a hunting
fire this announcement was read, and many
an <i>engagé's</i> heart beat high at the news, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Morgan was now the champion and hero of
the Buccaneers of America. Great numbers
flocked to the port in ships and canoes,
others traversed the woods and arrived there
by land, through a thousand dangers. Such
crowds came that it soon became difficult
to obtain a place in the crews. Vessels and
provisions were now all that was wanted.
Plunder was certain, and they had but to
choose on what rich coast they should land.
The French adventurers, ever gay and ready,
were first in the field. Morgan himself,
punctual and prompt, followed in the <i>Flying
Stag</i>, the St. Malo vessel we have before
mentioned, carrying forty-two guns. The
vessel had been lately confiscated and sold by
the governor of Jamaica, the unfortunate
captain escaping with his life, happy in being
free although penniless.</p>

<p>At the rendezvous on the 24th day of
October, 1670, 1600 men were present, and
twenty-four vessels assembled at the muster,
amid shouting, gun firing, flag waving,
and great joy and hope. Morgan's proposition
was to attack some rich place which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
well defended&mdash;the more danger the more
booty, for it was only rich places that the
Spaniards cared to defend. Several previous
expeditions had failed from want of provisions,
and the necessity of attacking small places to
obtain food gave the alarm to the Spaniards
and frustrated their plans. They therefore
resolved to visit La Rancheria, a small place on
the banks of the River de la Hache, on the
mainland, with four vessels and 400 men.
This was a place where corn and maize were
brought by the farmers for the supply of the
neighbouring city of Carthagena, and they
hoped to capture in the port some pearl
vessels from that place.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Morgan, not caring for
lesser prey, employed his men in careening,
cleaning, rigging, and pitching their vessels
ready for sea, that all might be ready to
weigh anchor the moment the expedition of
foragers returned. It augured terribly to
the Spaniard that it was necessary to sack a
town or two before the Buccaneer fleet could
even set sail.</p>

<p>Part of the men were in the woods boar-hunting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and others salting the flesh for the
voyage. Each crew had a certain part of the
woods allotted it for its own district, so
perfect was Morgan's discipline. Each party
prepared the salt pork for its own use, while
the cauldrons of pitch were smoking on the
beach, and the clank of the shipwrights'
hammers could be heard all night by the
hunters. The English, who were not so
expert in hunting as their Gallic brethren
(so says a French writer), generally took a
French hunter with them, to whom they
gave 150 or 200 piastres. Some of these
men had trained packs of dogs that would kill
enough boars in a day to load twenty or
thirty men.</p>

<p>The Rancheria expedition arrived in six
days within sight of the river, and was
unfortunately becalmed for some time within
a gunshot of land. This gave the Spaniards
time to prepare for their defence, and either
to bury their goods or throw up entrenchments,
for these repeated visits of the Buccaneers
had rendered them quick on such
occasions. A land-wind at last springing up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
gave a corn vessel from Carthagena, lying in
the river, an opportunity to sally out and
attempt its escape, but being a bad sailer it
was soon captured, much to the Englishmen's
delight, for corn was the object of their visit.
By a singular coincidence, it turned out to
be that very cocoa vessel which Lolonnois
sold to the governor of Tortuga, who, on its
return from France, had sold it to Captain
Champaigne, a French adventurer, who in
his turn sold it to the same merchant captain
who then commanded it. He told the Buccaneers
that it made the twelfth vessel taken
from him by the brotherhood of the coast in
five years only, and yet that with all these
losses he had contrived to make a fortune of
500,000 crowns. "On peut juger par là,"
says &#338;xmelin, with a shrug, "s'il y a des
gens riches dans l'Amérique."</p>

<p>Landing at daybreak, in spite of the
mowing fire from a battery, and under protection
of their own cannon, they drove the
Spaniards back to their strongly fortified
village, which they at once attacked. Here
the enemy rallied and fought desperately,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
hand-to-hand, sword blow and push of pike,
from ten in the morning till night, when
they fled, having suffered great loss, into
secret places in the woods. The Buccaneers,
who had suffered scarcely less loss, pushed
on at once headlong to the town, which they
found deserted; and next day pursuing the
Spaniards took many prisoners, and proceeded
to torture them, inflicting on fear and innocence
all the horrors of the Madrid inquisition.
In fifteen days they captured many prisoners
and much booty, and with the usual threats
of destroying the town, they obtained 4000
hanegs, or bushels of maize, sufficient for the
whole of the fleet. They preferred this to
money, and in three days, the whole quantity
being brought in by the people, eager for
their departure, they at once sailed.</p>

<p>Morgan, alarmed at their five weeks' absence,
had begun to despair of their return,
thinking Rancheria must have been relieved
from Carthagena or Santa Maria. He also
thought that they might have had good
fortune, and deserted him to return to Jamaica.
His joy was great to see them arrive laden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
with corn, and more in number than when
they departed. A council of war was actually
holding to plan a new expedition, when
Captain Bradley and his six vessels hove in
sight. The maize was divided among the
fleet, but the plunder was awarded to the
captain who had risked his life for the general
good.</p>

<p>The captured ship arrived very opportunely,
and it was instantly awarded by
general consent to Le Gascon, a French
adventurer who had lately lost his vessel.
Morgan having divided the meat and corn,
and personally inspected every bark, set sail
for Cape Tiburon, at the west end of Hispaniola,
a spot convenient for laying in stores
of wood and water. Here he was joined by
several ships from New England, refitted at
Jamaica. Morgan now found himself suzerain
of a fleet of thirty-seven vessels, large
and small, carrying sixteen, fourteen, twelve,
ten, even down to four pound guns. To
man these there were 2200 sailors, well
armed and ready for flight and plunder. The
fleet was divided into two squadrons, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
his vice-admiral and subordinate officers.
To the captains he gave letters-patent,
guaranteeing them from all the effects of
Spanish hostility, from "the open and declared
enemies of the King his master," (Charles II.)</p>

<p>The charter-party which we give elsewhere
was then signed, the rewards were
higher than usual, and many modifications
introduced. In the private council three places
were proposed as rich and accessible&mdash;Panama,
Carthagena, and Vera Cruz. In these
consultations the only thing considered was
whether a town was rich or poor, not whether
it was well or ill defended.</p>

<p>"The lot fell" on Panama, as the richest
of the three, though the least known to them,
being further from the North Pacific than
any Buccaneer had yet gone. Panama was
the galleon-port and the El Dorado of the
adventurer's yarns. Being so unknown a
place they determined to first recapture St.
Catherine's, where in the prisons they might
obtain many guides, who had seen both the
North and South Pacifics, for outlaws made,
they found, the best guides for outlaws; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
they agreed before sailing that, if they took
a Spanish vessel, the first captain who
boarded it should have for his reward a tenth
part of her cargo.</p>

<p>They had begun by sacking a town to
victual their fleet, they now proposed to
storm a fort to obtain a guide&mdash;St. Catherine's
batteries, if resolutely manned, being able to
beat off three such fleets.</p>

<p>The admiral, it was agreed, should have a
share for every hundred men, and every
captain eight shares if the vessel they took
was large. The crews then one by one took
the oath of fidelity. On the 18th December,
1670, the fleet set sail for St. Catherine's,
whose prisoners would rejoice at their arrival.</p>

<p>The one squadron carried the royal English
and the other a white flag. The admiral's
division bore a red banner with a white cross,
"le pavillon du parlement," and at the bow-sprit
one of three colours, blue, white, and
red. Those of the other divisions carried a
white and red flag. Morgan also appointed
peculiar signals for all emergencies.</p>

<p>On their way to St. Catherine's they chased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
two Dutch vessels from Cuba, which escaped
by aid of contrary winds that baffled their
pursuers. In four days the fleet arrived at
St. Catherine's, and Morgan despatched two
small vessels to guard the port.</p>

<p>This island was renowned for its vast flocks
of migratory pigeons, and is watered by four
streams, two of which are dry in summer.
The land, though fertile, was not cultivated.</p>

<p>The next day, before sunrise, they anchored
in the bay of Aguada Grande, where
the Spaniards had erected a four-gun battery.
Morgan, at the head of 100 men, landed and
made his way through the woods, having no
guides but some old Buccaneers who had
been there before with Mansvelt. On arriving
that night at the governor's house and
the Platform Battery they found the Spaniards
had retreated by a bridge into the smaller
and almost impregnable island, which they
had made strong enough to beat off 10,000
men. Being driven back at first by a tremendous
fire, Morgan was obliged to encamp
that night in the woods or open country&mdash;no
hardship to hunters or sailors in fine weather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
There still remained a whole league of dense
brush between them and their enemies, at once
their protection and destruction. A chilling
torrent of rain began to beat upon them, and
instead of ceasing, as they had hoped, lasted
till noon of the next day. They pulled
down two or three thatched huts, and made
small damp fires, that scorched a few but
warmed none. They could not shelter
themselves, and, what was worse, could not
keep their arms and powder dry. But more
than this, they suffered from hunger, having
had no food for a whole day. The men for
the greater part being dressed with no clothes
but a seaman's shirt and trowsers, and without
shoes or stockings, suffered dreadfully
after the burning of a tropic noon from this
freezing cold and rain. One hundred men,
says Esquemeling, even indifferently well
armed, might have cut them all to pieces.
At daybreak they were roused from their
shivering sleep by the Spanish drums beating
the <i>Diane</i>, or <i>reveillé</i>. The rain had now
ceased, and their courage rose as high as
ever. But they could not answer this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
challenge, for their own drums were loose
and soaked with wet, and they had now to
employ themselves in quickly drying their
arms. Scarcely had they done this, when it
began to cloud over and rain with increased
fury, as if the "sky were melting into
waters," which blinded them and prevented
them again from advancing to the attack.
Many of them grew faint-hearted, and talked
of returning. The men were now feeble for
want of sleep, and faint with cold and hunger.
The eager foragers found in a field "an old
horse, lean, and full of scabs and blotches, with
galled back and sides." This was instantly
killed and flayed, and divided in small pieces
among as many as could get any, and eagerly
eaten without salt or bread by the few lucky
epicures&mdash;"eaten," says the historian, "more
like ravenous wolves eat than men."</p>

<p>The rain still gushing down, and the men,
worn out in mind and body, growing angry, discontented,
and clamorous, it became necessary
for Morgan to act with promptitude. About
noon, to his great joy, the rain ceased and
the sun broke out. Taking advantage of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
this lull&mdash;for the rain had barred even their
retreat&mdash;Morgan ordered a canoe to be rigged
out in great haste, and dispatched four men
with a white flag to the Spanish governor,
declaring that if they did not all surrender
he would put them to the sword without
quarter. His audacity was luckily crowned
with success. Opposed armies are often men
mutually afraid, trying to frighten each other.
The governor was intimidated. He demanded
two hours to confer with his officers. At
the end of this time, on Morgan giving
hostages, two soldiers with white flags were
sent to arrange terms. The governor had
decided in full conference that he could not
defend the island against such an armada, but
he proposed a certain (Dalgetty-like) stratagem
of war to save his own head, and preserve
the reputation of his officers at home
and abroad.</p>

<p>Morgan was to come at night and assault
the fort of St. Jerome, which stood near the
bridge that joined the two islands, and at the
same moment his fleet was to attack the castle
of Santa Teresa by sea, and land troops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
near the battery of St. Matthew. These
men were to intercept and take prisoner
the governor as he made his way to the St.
Jerome batteries. He would then at once
lead them to the castle, as if they were his
own men. On both sides there was to be
continual firing, but only with powder, and
no bullets. The forts thus taken, the island
would of course surrender.</p>

<p>This well-arranged performance took place
with great <i>éclat</i>. Morgan, in acceding to the
terms, had insisted on their strict performance
of every item, and gave notice, for fear
of ambush, that every straggling Spaniard
would be shot. Afraid of a stratagem, some
Buccaneers loaded their muskets with ball,
and held themselves ready for any danger.
With much smoke and great consumption of
powder, the unsuspecting Spaniards were
driven like sheep into the church, the island
surrendered, and by this bloodless artifice
Spanish pride remained unhurt.</p>

<p>But a cruel massacre now commenced.
The Buccaneers had eaten nothing for nearly
two days. They made war upon all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
poultry and cattle&mdash;the oldest cow was slain,
the toughest rooster strangled. For several
days the island was lit up with huge fires,
round which the men roasted their meat, and
revelled and caroused. When wood grew
scarce they pulled down cottages to light
their fires, and having no wine very wisely
made use of water.</p>

<p>The day after the surrender they numbered
their prisoners, and found they had
collected 450 souls&mdash;seventy of the garrison,
forty-three children, and thirty-one slaves.
The men were all carefully disarmed, and
sent to the plantations to bring in provisions;
the women were left in the church to pray
and weep. They next inspected all the ten
batteries, wondering in their strength and
exulting in their victory. The fort St.
Jerome contained eight great guns and sixty
muskets; the St. Matthew three guns; the
Santa Teresa twenty guns and 120 muskets.
The castle was very strong, and moated;
impregnable on the sea side, and on the land
side ascended by a narrow mountain path,
while the guns on its summit commanded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
port. The St. Augustine fort mounted three
guns; the Platform two; the St. Salvador
and another also two; the Santa Cruz three;
and the St. Joseph six and twelve muskets.
In the magazine they found 30,000 pounds
of powder, which they at once shipped, with
all the other ammunition. In the St. Jerome
battery Morgan left a guard, but in all the
other forts the guns were spiked and the gun-carriages
burnt.</p>

<p>The object of his visit was still to seek.
Examining the prisoners, who were now
crowded in with merchants and grandees, he
inquired for banditti from Panama, and three
slaves stepped forward who knew every path
and avenue to the city. These men he chose as
guides, promising them a full Buccaneer's share
of the spoil if they brought him by a secure
way to the city, and, in addition, their liberty
when they reached Jamaica. These volunteers
consisted of two Indians and a mulatto.
The former denied all knowledge of the place;
the latter&mdash;a "rogue, thief, and assassin, who
had deserved breaking on the wheel rather
than mere garrison service"&mdash;readily accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Morgan's propositions, and promised to serve
him faithfully. He had a great ascendancy
over the two Indians, and domineered over
them as he pleased, without their daring to
disobey a half-blood already on the point
of preferment.</p>

<p>The next step to Panama was to capture
Chagres and its castle, and Morgan at once
dispatched five vessels, well equipped, with
400 men on board, to undertake this expedition,
remaining himself at St. Catherine's, lest
the people of Panama should be alarmed. He
was to follow his van-guard in eight days,
guided by the Indians, who knew Chagres.
This time he and his men prudently spent
in pulling manioc roots for cassava, and
digging potatoes for the voyage.</p>

<p>The Chagres expedition was led by the
same Captain Bradley who commanded at
Rancheria. He had been with Mansvelt
formerly, and had rendered himself famous
by his exploits both among the Buccaneers
and the Spaniards. He arrived in three
days at Chagres, opposite Fort St. Lawrence,
which was built on a mountain commanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
the entrance of the river. As soon as the
Spaniards saw the red flag spreading from his
vessels, they displayed the royal colours of
Spain, and saluted him with a volley too
hasty and angry to be very destructive. The
Buccaneers, according to their usual stratagem,
landed at Narangui, a place a quarter
of a league distant from the castle, their
guide leading them through thick woods,
through which they had to cut a path with
their sabres. It was early morning when they
landed, and requiring half a day to perform
the short distance, they did not reach a hill
commanding the castle till two o'clock. The
mire and dirt of the road combined, with the
darkness of the way, to lengthen their march.
The guides served them well, but brought
them at one spot so near to the castle, and
in so open and bare a place, that they lost
many men by the shot. In other parts the
wood was so thick that they could only tell
that they were near the castle by the discharge
of the cannon. The hill they had now
reached was not within musket range, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
they were thus deprived of the use of their
favourite weapon. Could they have dragged
cannon so far they might have taken the place
without losing a man.</p>

<p>The castle of Chagres was built on a high
mountain at the entry of a river, and surrounded
by strong wooden palisadoes banked
with earth. The top of the mountain was
divided into two parts, between which ran a
ditch thirty feet deep; the tower had but one
entrance by a drawbridge, towards the land
it had four bastions, and towards the sea two
more. The south wall was inaccessible crag,
the north was moated by the broad river.
At the foot of the hill lay a strong fort with
eight guns, which commanded the river's
mouth; a little lower down were two other
batteries, each of six guns, all pointing the
same way. At another side were two great
store-houses, full of goods, brought from the
inland, and near these a flight of steps, cut
in the rock, led to the castle of the summit.
On the west side was a small port not more
than seven or eight fathoms deep, with good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
anchorage for small vessels, and before the
hill a great rock rose from the waves, which
almost covered it at low water.</p>

<p>The place appeared such a perfect volcano
of fire, and so threatening and dangerous,
that the Buccaneers, but for fear of Morgan's
rage and contempt, would have at once turned
back. After many disputes and much doubt
and perplexity, they resolved to hazard the
assault and risk their lives. When they
descended from their hill into the plain, they
had to throw themselves on their faces to
escape the desolating shower of balls; but
their marksmen, quite uncovered and without
defence, shot at the Spanish gunners through
the loops of the palisading, and killed all
who showed themselves. This skirmishing
continued till the evening, when the
Buccaneers, who had lost many men, their
commander having his leg broken with a
cannon shot, began to waver and to think of
retiring, having in vain tried to burn down
the place with their fireballs, and charged up
to the very walls, which they tried in vain to
climb, sword in hand. When the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
saw them drawing back through the dusk, in
some disorder, carrying their wounded men
and gnashing their teeth in rage at the dark
lines of defence, they shouted out "Come on,
you dogs of heretics; come on, you English
devils: you shan't get to Panama this bout,
for we'll serve your comerades as we have
served you." The Buccaneers, astonished at
their cries, now for the first time learnt that
Morgan's expedition had been heard of at
Panama.</p>

<p>Night had already begun, and the rain of
bullets, shot, and Indian arrows (more deadly
almost than the bullets), harassing and well-aimed,
continued as grievous as by day.
Taking advantage of the gloom, another
party advanced to the palisadoes; the light of
their burning fuses directed the aim of the
Spaniards.</p>

<p>A singular accident of war gave the place,
so briskly defended, into the hands of the
assailants. A party of the French musketeers
were talking together, devising a plan
of advance, when a swift Indian arrow fell
among them and pierced one of the speakers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
in the shoulder (Esquemeling says in the
back and right through the body, another
writer says in the eye). A thought struck the
wounded man, for the wound had spurred his
imagination: coolly drawing the point from
his shoulder, he said to those near him,
"Attendez, mes frères, je m'en vais faire périr
tous les Espagnols&mdash;tous&mdash;avec cette sacré
flèche" (wait a bit, my mates, I'll kill all the
Spaniards&mdash;all&mdash;with this d&mdash;&mdash; arrow); so
saying he drew from his pocket a handful of
wild cotton, which the Buccaneers kept as
lint to staunch their wounds, and wound it
round the dart; then putting it in his loaded
musket, from which he extracted the ball, he
fired it back at the castle roof. It alighted on
some dry thatch, which in a moment began
to smoke, and in another second broke into a
bright flame, more visible for the darkness.
The Buccaneers shouted and pushed on to the
attack, and the wounded men forgot their
wounds. Some of the men, seeing the result
of the experiment, gathered up the Indian
arrows that lay thick around them, and fired
them at the roofs. Many houses were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
in flames. The Spaniards, busy with the
defence, did not see the fire until it had
gained some head, and reaching a parcel of
powder blown it up and caused ruin and consternation
within the fort. If they left the
walls the Buccaneers gained ground, if they
left the fire the flames spread more terribly
than before; the want of sufficient water
increased the confusion, and while they tried
to quench the conflagration, the Buccaneers
set fire to the palisadoes.</p>

<p>&#338;xmelin, who was present as a surgeon at
this attack of Chagres, relates an anecdote
of courage which he himself witnessed, to
show the indomitable fury of the assailants.
One of his own friends was pierced in the eye
by an Indian arrow, and came to him to beg
him to pull it out, the pain was so intense
and unbearable. Although a surgeon, &#338;xmelin
had not the nerve to inflict such
torture, however momentary, on a friend,
and turned away in pity, upon which the
hardy seaman tore out the arrow with a
curse, and, binding up the wound, rushed
forward to the wall. The few Buccaneers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
who had retreated, seeing the flames, now
hurried back to the attack. The Spaniards
could no longer see the enemy at whom they
fired, the night was so dark and starless,
while the Buccaneers shot down with the
unerring aim of hunters the Spaniards, whose
bodies stood out dark and well-defined against
the bright background of flame. All this
time, before the fire of the roofs could be
extinguished, the Buccaneers had swarmed
through the fosse, and, mounting upon each
other's shoulders, burnt down part of the
palisadoes, as we have before described, in
spite of the hand grenades that were thrown
from above, and which burst among them.
The fire ran along the wall, leaping like a
winged thing, and devoured wherever it
clung, spreading with dreadful rapidity.</p>

<p>The fight continued all night, and when
the calm daylight broke on the worn soldiers,
the Buccaneers saw with sparkling eyes
that the gabions had smouldered through,
and that the earth had fallen down in large
heaps into the fosse. The breaches in many
places were practicable. The armour had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
fallen piece-meal from their giant adversary,
and he now stood before them bare, wounded,
and defenceless. The Buccaneers, creeping
within musket shot of the walls, shot down
the gunners in the breaches to which the
cannon had been dragged by the governor's
orders during the night. Divided into two
bands, one party kept up a constant fire on
the guns, and the other watched the motions
of the enemy. About noon they advanced
to a spot which the governor himself defended,
belted round with twenty-five brave
Spaniards, armed with pikes, halberds, swords,
and muskets. They advanced under a dreadful
hail of fire and lead, the defenders casting
down flaming pots full of combustible matter
and "<i>odious smells</i>," which destroyed many of
the English. But we do not know how smells
could drive back men who would have
marched through hell if it had been the
shortest way to Panama.</p>

<p>Nothing could equal the unflinching courage
of the Spaniards&mdash;they disputed every
inch of ground&mdash;they yielded slowly like
wounded lions when the hunters narrow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
their circles. They showered stones and all
available missiles on their assailants, only
wishing to kill a Buccaneer, but feeling that
resistance was hopeless; some, rather than
yield, threw themselves from the cliffs into
the sea, and few survived the fall. As the
Buccaneers won their way to the castle the
Spaniards retreated to the <i>garde du corps</i>,
where they entrenched themselves with two
cannon; to the last the governor refused
quarter, and at last fell shot through the
brain. The few who remained surrendered
when the guns were taken and would have
been turned against them.</p>

<p>Only fourteen men were found unhurt in
the fort and about nine or ten wounded, who
had hid themselves among the dead. They
told Morgan that they were all that were
left of a garrison of 314 soldiers. The
governor, seeing that he was lost, had despatched
the survivors to Panama to alarm the
city, and remained behind to die. No officer
was left alive; they had been the first to set
their men the example of a glorious death.
It appeared that a Buccaneer deserter, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Irishman, whom Morgan had not even informed
of his design, had come to the port,
and assured them of the attack on La Rancheria,
and the contemplated movement on
Panama. The governor of that place had
instantly sent to Chagres a reinforcement of
164 men, with ammunition and provisions,
and had placed ambuscades along the river.
He was at that very moment, they said,
awaiting them in the savannah with 3600
men: of these 2000 were infantry, 400
cavalry, and 600 Indians. He had also employed
200 muleteers and hunters to collect
a drove of 1000 wild cattle to drive down
upon the invaders.</p>

<p>"The taking of this castle," says Esquemeling,
"cost the pirates excessively dear,
in comparison to what they were wont to
lose, and their toil and labour was greater
than at the conquest of the Isle of St.
Catherine." On numbering their thinned
ranks, many voices were silent at the roll
call. More than 100 men were found to be
dead, and more than seventy grievously
wounded. There were sixty who could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
rise, and many in the ranks wore on their arms
strips of the Spanish colours, or had their
heads bound round with bloody cloths. The
prisoners they compelled to drag their own
dead to the edge of the cliffs and cast them
among the shattered bodies on the beach, and
then to bury them where the sea could not
wash them out of their graves, or the birds
devour them. The castle chapel they turned
into an hospital for the wounded, and the
female slaves were employed to tend them,
for the surgeons in the heat of battle had
only had time to amputate a limb or bind
an artery.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<small>CONQUEST OF PANAMA.</small></h2>

<p>The bodies of their comerades, who had
died that they who survived might conquer,
were buried, not without some tears even
from these rude men, in large (plague pit)
graves, dug by the prisoners. The women
were violated in the first fury of the sack.
During their plunder they found a great
quantity of provisions and ammunitions stored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
up for the use of the fleet. Their next act
was to repair the fort and render it tenable.</p>

<p>Morgan, instantly informed of the fall of
Chagres, did not remain long behind. Having
first collected all the Indian wheat and
cassava he could carry, he embarked his
prisoners and provisions, taking with him
Don Joseph Ramirez de Leiba, the governor,
and the chief officers. The cannon he spiked
or threw into the sea, in places where he
might recover them, intending to return and
fortify the place, as a stronghold if his design
on Panama failed. The forts, and church,
and house he fired, with the exception of the
castle of Santa Teresa.</p>

<p>In sailing to Chagres a storm arose and
dispersed his vessels, keeping them many
days at sea. The admiral, always watchful
in danger, suffered himself for a moment to
sleep in the hour of prosperity. When he
approached the river mouth and saw the
English flag floating from the blackened
walls, he could not restrain the heedless joy
of his crew&mdash;not waiting for the pilot canoe
that was putting out to warn them of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
danger, he drove on the sunken rock at the
foot of the castle hill. His own and three
other vessels sank, yet the crews and cargoes
were all saved, and but for a strong "norther"
the ships themselves would have been
preserved.</p>

<p>Brought into the castle with acclamations
and hearty congratulations at his escape,
Morgan employed the Spanish prisoners from
St. Catherine's in repairing the palisading
of the fort, carefully destroying all thatched
sheds for fear of fire. He then chose a garrison
by lot, and divided the stores. He
heard with delight the details of the victory,
and lamented the absent dead and the many
brave men that had shared so often his
own hopes and fears. His next movement
was to seize some <i>chatten</i>, or small Spanish
vessels that were still in the river. They
were small craft that went to and fro between
Chagres and Porto Bello, or Nicaragua, or
plied with merchandise up and down the
river. They mounted six guns, two iron,
and four small brass, and were navigated by
six men. He also took four small frigates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
of fourteen and eight guns, and all the canoes
he could lay hands on, requiring them for
the expedition. He left behind him 100
men, under command of Captain Le Maurice,
and 150 men to guard the ships.</p>

<p>For Panama, Morgan took with him 1300
of the best armed and the most robust of his
band, five boats with artillery, and thirty-two
canoes. He imprudently carried little provisions,
expecting to obtain plenty from the
Spaniards they should kill in the ambuscades.
In spite of the recent victory, and of Morgan's
certainty of conquest, many of the Buccaneers
were less sanguine than on former
expeditions. The Spanish prisoners had
succeeded in alarming them by rumours of
the dangers and intricacy of the road, and
the ambuscades that had been two months in
preparation. Some, more superstitious than
the rest, thought the wreck of Morgan's ship,
and the severe loss at Chagres, bad omens
for their success at Panama. But these were
mocked at by the rest, as white-livered, and
Morgan having divided the provisions between
the garrison and the St. Catherine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
prisoners, reviewed his men, and examined
himself their arms and ammunition. He
quieted their fears and spoke of victory as
already obtained. He exhorted them to show
more than usual courage, in order to return
as soon as possible rich and glorious to
Jamaica. With a shout of "Long live the
King of England, and long live Henry Morgan,"
they began their march towards the
doomed city on the 18th of January, 1670.</p>

<p>The first day they advanced only six
leagues to Rio de los Braços, where they got
out of their canoes to sleep on shore, being
crippled with overcrowding in the boats.
They could have brought no provisions, for
few had any food that day, but a pipe of
tobacco "to stop the orifice of the stomach."
They could find nothing in the deserted
plantations, where even the unripe fruits had
been plucked and the roots pulled up before
their arrival. The men longed to fight, in order
that they might eat. By noon of the next day
they reached Cruz de Juan Gallego, where they
were obliged to leave their canoes; the river
was very dry and shallow from want of rain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
and much impeded with fallen trees, but
their hopes were excited by the guide's
intelligence, that about two leagues further
the roads grew better. Here they left their
boats with 160 men to guard them, as a
resource in case of defeat, giving them strict
injunctions not to land for fear of ambuscades
in the neighbouring woods, which were so
thick as to seem impenetrable. Finding the
forest almost impassable, Morgan ordered a
few of the canoes to be rowed, though with
immense labour, to a place called Cedro
Bueno, further up the river, taking half the
men at a time and returning for the rest,
so by nightfall all the men were once more
united. From discovering no ambuscades,
in spite of all the wishes of these hungry
soldiers, it was supposed that the Spanish spies,
willing to avoid a fight, had frightened their
officers by exaggerating the number of the
adventurers. On the third day Morgan sent
forward some guides, who could find no
road, the country being flat, inundated, and
marshy. The men, who had scarcely eaten
anything since their departure, grew faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
and hungry, and a few of them gathered the
leaves from the forest trees. It being night
before they could pass the river, they slept
on the bank, exposed, half-clothed as they
were, to the tropical damps and cold.</p>

<p>The fourth day's march they advanced in
divisions; the largest went by land, the
smaller in canoes. The guides were always
kept two musket shots in advance, to give
notice of ambuscades, and in hopes of capturing
stragglers who might furnish intelligence.
But the Spaniards had also scouts, very wary,
and very "dexterous" in giving notice of all
accidents, frequently bringing the Panama
men intelligence of the Buccaneers' approach
six hours before the enemy arrived. About
noon the army reached a post named Torna
Cavallos, so called probably from the roughness
of the road, and at this spot the guide
of the canoes cried out that he saw an ambuscade.
With infinite joy, the hungry men,
thirsting for blood, flew to arms, knowing that
the Spaniards always went luxuriously provided
with food, and knowing that a dead
Spaniard could want no more provender. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
soon as they came within sight of the entrenchment,
which was shaped like a half-moon,
and the palisading formed of entire
trees, they uttered a dreadful shout, and,
driven on by rage and hunger, began to race
like starved wolves, seeing which could first
cross swords with the enemy, whom they
believed to be about 400 strong. But their
hearts fell within them when they found
the place a mere deserted rampart, and all
the provisions, but a few crumbs which
lay scattered about, either burnt or carried
off. Some leather bags lay here and there,
as if left in a hasty retreat. Enraged at
this, they at once pulled down the Spanish
huts, and cutting the leather bags, tore
them up for food. Quarrels then arose for
the largest messes, but before they could well
finish this unsavoury banquet, the drum
sounded for the march. About 500 Spaniards
seem to have held these entrenchments, and
many of the men threatened to devour the
first fugitive they could meet with. About
night they reached another deserted ambuscade,
called Torna Munni, equally bare of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
food, and the remainder of the bags were now
devoured. Those fortunate enough to obtain
a strip first soaked slices of it in water, next
beat it between two stones, then scraped off
the hair with their hunters' knives, and,
roasting it in the fire, ate it leisurely in small
pieces. "I can assure the reader," says
&#338;xmelin, "that a man can live on this fare,
but he can hardly get <i>very fat</i>." Frequent
draughts of water (which, by good fortune,
they had at hand) seasoned this not very
palatable food of men accustomed to revel
on venison and brandy. "Some who were
never out of their mothers' kitchens," says
Esquemeling, "may ask how these pirates
could eat and digest those pieces of leather,
so hard and dry, whom I answer, that could
they once experience what hunger, or rather
famine, is, they would find the way as the
pirates did."</p>

<p>The fifth day at noon they arrived at a
place called Barbacoa, where there were more
deserted barricades, and the adjacent plantations
were equally bare of either man, animal,
or plant. Searching with all the zeal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
perseverance of hungry men, they found at
last, buried in the floor of a cave lately hewn
out of the rock, two sacks of flour, two jars
of wine, and some plantains, and Morgan
generously divided these among the most
exhausted of his troops, some being now
nearly dead with famine. The flour they
mixed with water, and, wrapping the dough
in banana leaves, baked it in the fire.
Somewhat refreshed, they renewed their
march with increased skill and vigour. The
lagging men they placed in the canoes, till
they reached at night some deserted plantations
known as the Tabernillas, where they
slept.</p>

<p>On the sixth day they marched slowly,
after resting a time from real weakness,
some of the strongest being sent into the
woods to pluck berries and pull roots, many
even eating leaves and grass. The same day
at noon they arrived at a plantation. Eagerly
foraging here, but not expecting to find anything,
they turned a little from the road, and
came upon a barn full of maize in the husk.
Beating down the door, they fell upon it and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
devoured it as rapaciously as a herd of swine,
till they fell off satiated. A distribution was
then made of it to each man, for hunger does
not care for cooking. Loaded with this grain
they continued their march in high spirits
for about two hours, when they came suddenly
on about 200 Indians, and soon after passed
a deserted ambuscade. Those who had maize
still left threw it away, thinking that the
Spaniards and better food were at hand.
These archers were on the opposite side of
the river. The Buccaneers, firing, killed a
few, and pursued the others as far as Santa
Cruz. The nimblest escaped by swimming,
and two or three adventurers, who waded
after them, were pierced with arrows at the
ford. The Indians, as they fled, hooted&mdash;"Ah
perros Ingleses, à la savanah, à la savanah:"
"<i>English dogs, English dogs, come to the
savannah.</i>" Passing the river they were
now compelled to begin their march on the
opposite side. There was little sleep that
night, but great dejection, and murmurs
arose against Captain Morgan and his conduct.
He was blamed for not having brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
provisions, and for not having yet met the
Spaniards; condemned for irreconcilable
errors, and reviled for even his past successes.
Some declared they would return home, others
would willingly have done so, yet were afraid
to retreat; but a large party declared they
would rather die than go back a step. One
of the guides, perhaps bribed by Morgan,
promised that it should not be long before
they met with people from whom they
should derive no small advantage, and this
comforted them. A tinge of superstition
would have soon converted this into one of
those prophecies by which Cromwell and
Cortes both consoled their desponding
troopers.</p>

<p>On the seventh morning, expecting enemies,
the men all cleaned their arms, and
every one discharged his musket and pistols
without ball to let the Spaniards hear they
were coming, and that their ammunition was
not damaged. Leaving Santa Cruz, where
they had rested, they crossed the river in
their canoes, and arrived at the town of Cruz.</p>

<p>At some distance from Cruz they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
beheld to their great joy a great smoke rising
above the roofs, which they thought arose
from kitchen chimneys, and quickening their
pace they began to laugh, and shout, and
leap,&mdash;joking at the Spanish waste of fuel,
and saying, "the Spanish cooks are roasting
meat for our dinner when we have mastered
their masters;" but as the smoke grew
thicker, they began to think that the enemy
were burning some houses that interfered
with the fire of the entrenchments.</p>

<p>Two hours after, on arriving panting and
hot at Cruz, they found the place deserted
and stripped, and no meat, but many fires,
for every Spaniard had burnt his own house,
and only the royal store-house and stables
were left standing. A few crackling ruins
were all that remained of the great halfway
house between Chagres and Panama, for
here the Chagres merchandise was always
landed and transported to Panama on the
backs of mules, being distant only twenty-six
Spanish leagues from the river of Chagres,
and eight from Panama. The disappointed
Buccaneers spent the remainder of the day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
at Cruz in seeking food and resting. Every
cat and dog was soon killed and eaten, for the
cattle had been all driven off. Morgan, growing
now more strict in discipline, gave orders
that no party of less than 100 men should
leave the town. Five or six Englishmen
who disobeyed the order were killed by the
Indians. In the king's stables fifteen or
sixteen jars of Peruvian wine were found,
and a leather sack full of biscuit. Morgan,
afraid that his men would fall into excesses,
spread a report that the Spaniards had
poisoned the wine&mdash;a report confirmed by the
violent sickness of all who drank of it; although
half-starved men, fed for a week on
vegetable refuse, would have been injured by
any excess. It was, however, eagerly drunk,
and would have been had there been death
in every cup. This sickness detained them
a day at Cruz. The canoes, being now
useless, were sent back, guarded by sixty
men, to join the other boats, one alone being
hid in a thicket for fear of any emergency
or any necessity arising, and to transmit
intelligence to the vessels. He feared that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
if left at Cruz, they might be captured, and
would at least require an extra guard.</p>

<p>On the eighth day at morning Morgan
reviewed his troop, and found he had 1100
able and resolute men still at his back. He
persuaded them that their comerade who was
carried off by the Indians had returned,
having only lost his way in the woods,
fearing they might be discouraged at his
disappearance. He then chose a band of
the best marksmen as a forlorn hope, and a
"hundred of these men," says &#338;xmelin,
"are worth six hundred of any other nation."
He divided the remainder into a van and
wings, knowing that he should have to pass
many places where not more than two men
could pass abreast.</p>

<p>After ten hours' march they arrived at a
place called <i>Quebrada Obscura</i>, a dark wooded
gorge where the sunlight rarely entered.
Here, on a sudden, a shower of 300 or 400
arrows poured down upon them, killing eight
or nine men, and wounding ten. These arrows
came from an Indian ambuscade hid
on a wooded and rocky mountain, perforated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
by a natural arch, through which only one
laden beast could pass. The Buccaneers,
though they could see nothing but rocks and
trees, instantly returned the fire, and two
Indians rolled down into the path. One of
these, who appeared to be a chief, for he
wore a coronet of variegated feathers, attempted
to stab an English adventurer with
his javelin, but a companion, parrying the
thrust with his sabre, slew the Indian. This
brave man was, it is supposed, the leader of
the ambuscade, for the savages seeing him
fall took at once to flight, and never discharged
another shaft. As they entered
a wood the rest of the Indians fled to seize
the next height, from whence they might
observe them and harass their march. The
Buccaneers found them too swift to capture,
and pursued them in vain: but two or three
of the wounded fugitives were found dead
in the road. A few armed and disciplined
men could have made this pass good against
a hundred, but these Indians were now
scattered and without a leader, and they had
only fired at random, and in haste, through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
trees and thickets that intercepted their arrows.
On leaving this defile the Buccaneers
entered a broad prairie, where they rested
while the wounded were tended. At a long
distance before them they could see the
Indians on a rocky eminence, commanding
the road where they must pass. Fifty active
men were dispatched to take them in the
rear in the hopes of obtaining some prisoners,
but all in vain, for the Indians were not only
more agile but knew all the passes. Two
hours after they were seen at about two gunshots'
distance, on the same eminence from
which they had been just driven, while the
Buccaneers were now on an opposite height,
and between them lay a wood. The Buccaneers
supposed that a Spanish ambuscade was
hid here, for whenever they came near enough
the Indians cried out "À la savanah, à la
savanah, cornudos perros Ingleses:" "To the
savannah, to the savannah, you cuckold English
dogs." Morgan sent 100 men to search
this wood, and upon this the Spaniards and
Indians came down from the mountain as if
to attack them, but appeared no more.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span></p>

<p>About night, a great rain falling, the Buccaneers
marched faster, in order to prevent
their arms getting wet, but they could find
no houses to barrack in, for the Indians had
burnt them all and driven away the cattle,
hoping to starve out the men whom they
could not drive out. They left the main
road after diligent search, and found a few
shepherds' huts, but too few to shelter all
their company; they therefore piled their
arms, and chose a small number from each
company to guard them. Those who slept in
the open air endured much hardship, the rain
not ceasing all night. They made temporary
sheds, which they covered with boughs, in
order to sleep under a shelter, however imperfect;
and sentinels were placed, Morgan
being afraid of the Indians, who chose wet
nights for their onslaughts, when fire-arms
were often useless.</p>

<p>Next morning very early, being the ninth
of their tedious journey, they recommenced
their march, Morgan bidding them all discharge
their guns and then reload them, for
fear of the wet having damped the powder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
The fresh air of the morning, clear after the
storm, was still about them, and the clouds
had not yet yielded to the tropical sun as
they pushed on over a path more difficult
than before. In about two hours' time a
band of twenty Spaniards began to appear
in the distance, and the Indians were also
visible, but Morgan could obtain no prisoners,
though he offered a reward of 300 crowns
for every Spaniard brought in. When pursued
the enemy hid themselves in caves and
eluded all search.</p>

<p>At last, toiling slowly up a high mountain,
the adventurers unexpectedly beheld from
the top the South Sea glittering in the
distance. This caused them as great joy as
the sight of "Thalatta" did to the soldiers of
Xenophon. They thought their expedition
now completed, for to them victory was a
certainty. They could discern upon the sea,
never before beheld, a large ship and six
small boats setting forth from Panama to the
islands of Tavoga and Tavogilla, which were
only six leagues distant. Fortune smiled
upon them to-day, for, descending this mountain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
they came into a grassy prairie valley,
full of all sorts of cattle, which were being
pursued by mounted Spaniards, who fled at
the sight of the Buccaneers. Upon these
animals Morgan's men rushed with the avidity
of half-starved hunters, the eagerness
of sailors to obtain fresh meat, and all the
haste that brave men exhibit to get at an
enemy. One shot a horse, another felled
a cow, but the greater part slaughtered the
mules, which were the most numerous.
Some kindled fires, others collected wood,
and the strongest hunted the cattle, while
the invalids slew, and skinned, and flayed.
The whole plain was soon alight with a
hundred fires. The hungry men cut off
lumps of flesh, carbonadoed them in the
flame, and ate them half raw with incredible
haste and ferocity. "They resembled," Esquemeling
says, "rather cannibals than
Christians, the blood running down their
beards to the middle of their bodies." But
no hunger, no fear, no passion threw Morgan
off his guard. Hungry and weary himself,
and sympathising with his men's hunger, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
saw the danger of this reckless gluttony,
which produced a reaction of inertness as
dangerous as intoxication. Dreading surprise,
for he was surrounded by enemies, he
beat a false alarm, and seizing their arms, his
men, ashamed of their excess, renewed their
march. The remainder of the meat, half-roasted
or quite raw, they strung to their
bandoliers. "The very look of these men,"
says Esquemeling, "was enough to have
terrified the boldest, for we know that in
love as well as war, the eyes are the soonest
conquered." Morgan, anxious at not having
yet obtained a prisoner as guide, again despatched
a vanguard of fifty men, who about
evening saw in the distance 500 Spaniards,
who shouted to them they knew not what.</p>

<p>Soon after, almost at dusk, mounting a
small eminence, they saw a better sight than
even the South Sea&mdash;the highest steeples of
Panama, bright in the sunset; upon this,
like the German soldiers at the sight of the
Rhine, the Buccaneers gave three cheers, to
show their extreme joy, leaping and shouting,
and throwing their hats into the air as if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
had already won the victory. At the same
time the drums beat stormily and proudly, and
each man shot off his piece, while the red
flag was displayed and waved in defiance of
the Spaniard, and high above all the trumpet
sounded.</p>

<p>The camp was pitched for the night by the
men, who waited impatiently for the morning
when the battle should join; with equal pride
and courage 200 mounted Spaniards shouted
in return as they dashed up within musket
shot, "To-morrow, to-morrow, ye dogs, we
shall meet in the savannah;" and as they
ended, their trumpet sounded clearer than
even that of Morgan's. These horsemen
were soon joined by several companies of
infantry and several squadrons of cavalry, who
wheeled round them within cannon shot.
These troops had been despatched when the
sounds of the Buccaneers' approach reached the
gates of the city. There were still two hours
of light, but Morgan determined not to fight
till early in the morning, when he might
be able to move freely in the unknown
country, and when there would be a whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
clear, bright day for the battle. As night drew
on all the Spaniards retired to the city, excepting
seven or eight troopers, who hovered
about to watch the enemy's motions and
give the alarm, if a night attack was contemplated.
On his side Morgan placed
double sentinels, and every now and then
ordered false alarms to be beat to keep his
men on the alert. Those who had any meat
left ate it raw, as they had often done when
hunters. No fires were allowed to be kindled,
and the men lying, ready armed, on the
grass, waited eagerly for the daylight. 120
cavaliers again joined the Spanish scouts,
and affected to maintain a strict blockade,
and the city all night played with its biggest
guns upon the camp, but being at so great
a distance did little harm to the Buccaneers.</p>

<p>At daybreak of the tenth day of their
march the Spaniards beat the <i>Diane</i>, and
Morgan, replying heartily, began with great
eagerness to push forward to the city, the
Spaniards wheeling cautiously around his
wings. One of the guides warned Morgan
against the high road, which he knew would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
be blocked up and crowded with ambuscades,
and the army defiled into a wood to the right,
where the passage was so difficult that none
but Buccaneers could have forced a way,
"very irksome indeed," says Esquemeling.
The Spaniards, completely baffled and astonished
by this diversion, left their batteries
in a hurry, and, without any distinct plan of
attack, crowded out into the plain. After
two hours' march the Buccaneers reached the
top of a small hill. From this eminence they
could now see their goal, and Panama, with
all the roofs that hid its treasure, lay before
them. Below, on the plain, they might also
discern the Spanish army drawn up in battalia,
awaiting their descent. Even Esquemeling
admits that the forces seemed numerous.
"There were two squadrons of cavalry,
four regiments of foot, and a still more terrible
enemy, a huge number of wild bulls,
roaring and tossing their horns, driven by a
great number of Indians, and a few negroes
and mounted matadors." The historian,
more truthful in his confessions than his
boasts, says, "They were surprised with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
fear, much doubting the fortune of the day;
yea, few or none there were but wished
themselves at home, or at least free from the
obligation of that engagement, it so nearly
concerning their lives. Having been for
some time wavering in their minds, they at
last reflected on the strait they had brought
themselves into, and that now they must
either fight resolutely or die, for no quarter
could be expected from an enemy on whom
they had committed so many cruelties. Hereupon
they encouraged one another, resolving
to conquer or spend the last drop of their
blood."</p>

<p>They then divided themselves into three
battalions, sending before 200 Buccaneers,
very dexterous at their guns, who descended
the hill, marching directly upon the Spaniards,
and the battle closed. The Spanish
cavalry uttered cries of joy, as if they were
going to a bull-fight. The infantry shouted
"Viva el rey!" and the vari-coloured silks
of their doublets glistened in the sun. The
Buccaneers, giving three cheers, charged
upon the enemy. The forlorn hope Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
despatched against the cavalry and the bulls.
The cavalry galloped forward to meet them,
but, the ground being marshy, they could not
advance with speed, and sank one by one
before the unceasing dropping fire of 200
Buccaneers, who fell on one knee and poured
in a full volley of shot, the foot and horse
in vain trying to break through this hot
line of flame and death. The bulls proved
as fatal to those who employed them, as the
elephants to Porus. Driven on the rear of
the Buccaneers, they took fright at the noise
of the battle, a few only broke through the
English companies, and trampled the red
colours under foot, but these were soon shot
by the old hunters; a few fled to the savannah,
and the rest tore back and carried
havoc through the Spanish ranks.</p>

<p>The firing lasted for two hours; at the
end of that time the cavalry and infantry
had separated, and the troopers had fled,
only about fifty of their number succeeding
in escaping. The infantry, discouraged at
their defeat, and despairing of success, fired
off one more volley, and then threw down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
their arms; the victory was won. Morgan,
having no cavalry, could not pursue, and
a mountain soon hid the fugitives from the
Buccaneers' sight, who would not follow,
expecting the flight was a mere decoy to
lure them into an ambuscade. The Buccaneers,
weary and faint, threw themselves
down to rest. A few Spaniards, found hiding
in the bushes by the sea-shore, were at once
slain, and several cordeliers belonging to the
army, being dragged before Morgan, were
pistolled in spite of all their cries and entreaties.
A Spanish captain of cavalry was
taken prisoner by the English musketeers,
who had hitherto given no quarter, and
confessed that the governor of Panama had
led out that morning 2000 men, 200 bulls,
1450 horse, and twenty-four companies of
foot, 100 men in each, sixty Indians, and
some negroes. In the city, he said, were
many trenches and batteries, and at the entrance
a fort with fifty men and eight brass
guns. The women and wealth had all been
sent to Tavoga, and 600 men with twenty-eight
pieces of cannon were inside the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
defended by ramparts of flour sacks. The
ambuscade had been waiting fifteen days in
the savannah, expecting Morgan.</p>

<p>On reviewing their men, the English
found a much greater number of killed and
wounded than they had expected, so Esquemeling
confesses, but does not give the number.
&#338;xmelin puts the loss at only two
killed and two wounded, an incredible statement,
trustworthy as he generally is. The
Spaniards lost 600 men.</p>

<p>"The pirates, nothing discouraged," says
the former historian, "seeing their number
so diminished, but rather filled with greater
pride, perceiving what huge advantage they
had obtained against their enemies, having
rested some time, prepared to march courageously
towards the city, plighting their
oaths one to another, that they would fight
till not a man was left alive. With this
courage they recommenced their march, either
to conquer or be conquered, carrying with
them all the prisoners."</p>

<p>They avoided the high road from Vera
Cruz, on which the Spaniards had placed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
battery of eight pieces of cannon, and selecting
that from Porto Bello, they advanced to the
town before the people could rally, and while
the exaggerated rumours of the defeat were
still uncontradicted. Trembling fugitives
filled the streets, and terror was in every
face.</p>

<p>The Spaniards fought desperately, but
without hope. In spite of Morgan's endeavour
to maintain strict discipline, his men
began to undervalue the enemy, and to advance
straggling and reckless. The Spaniards,
observing this, fired a broadside, killing
twenty-five or thirty of the vanguard
at the first discharge, and wounding nearly as
many, but before they could reload were
overpowered and slain at their guns, the
Buccaneers stabbing all whom they met.</p>

<p>Of this attack, Esquemeling gives the following
graphic but rambling account: "They
found much difficulty in their approach to
the city, for within the town the Spaniards
had placed many great guns at several quarters,
some charged with small pieces of iron,
and others with musket bullets. With all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
these they saluted the pirates at their approaching,
and gave them full and frequent
broadsides, firing at them incessantly, so that
unavoidably they shot at every step great
numbers of men. But neither these manifest
dangers of their lives, nor the sight of so
many as dropped continually at their sides,
could deter them from advancing, and gaining
ground every moment on the enemy; and
though the Spaniards never ceased to fire
and act the best they could for their defence,
yet they were forced to yield after three hours'
combat, and the pirates having possessed
themselves, killed and destroyed all that
attempted in the least to oppose them."</p>

<p>Morgan was now master of Panama, as he
had been of St. Catherine's, la Rancheria,
Maracaibo, and Gibraltar, but his vigilance
did not yet relax. As soon as the first fury
of their entrance was over, he assembled his
men, and commanded them, under great penalties,
not to drink or taste any wine, as he
had been informed by a prisoner that it had
been poisoned by the Spaniards. Though much
wealth had been hidden, great warehouses of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
merchandise, they rejoiced to find, were still
well stocked with silks, cloths, and linens.
Morgan's only fear now was, that with so
small a body of men as remained to him, the
Spaniards might rally, or his men, grown intoxicated
by success and intent on plunder,
be cut off without resistance. Having placed
guards at all the important points of defence
within and without the city, he ordered
twenty-five men to seize a boat laden with
merchandise, that owing to the low water in
the harbour could not put out to sea. The
command of this vessel he gave to an English
captain.</p>

<p>The houses of Panama were built chiefly
of cedar, and a few of stone.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Michael Scott sketches for
us nearly the whole scenery of Morgan's
march. One side of the harbour of Chagres
is formed, he says, by a small promontory
that runs 500 yards into the sea. This bright
little bay looks upon an opposite shore, long
and muddy, and covered with mangroves to
the water's brink. On the uttermost bluff
is a narrow hill, with a fort erected on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
its apex. The rock is precipitous on three
sides. The river of Chagres is about 100
yards across, and very deep. It rolls sluggishly
along, through a low, swampy country.
It is covered down to the water with
thick sedges and underwood, and where the
water is stagnating, generates mosquitoes and
fevers. The gigantic trees grow close to the
water, and are laced together by black, snake-like
withes. Here and there, black, slimy
banks of mud slope out near the shore, and
on these, monstrous alligators roll or sleep,
like logs of rotting drift-wood. For some
miles below Cruz, where the river ceases to
be navigable by canoes, oars are laid aside,
and long poles used to propel the boats,
like punts, over the shoals. Panama is distant
about seven leagues from Cruz. The
roads are only passable for mules: in some
places it has been hewn out of the rock, and
zig-zags along the face of hills, in parts
scarcely passable for two persons meeting.</p>

<p>"The scenery on each side is very beautiful,
as the road winds for the most part amongst
steeps, overshadowed by magnificent trees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
among which birds of all sizes, and of the
most gorgeous plumage, are perpetually glancing,
while a monkey every here and there
sits grimacing and chattering overhead. The
small, open savannahs gradually grow larger,
and the clear spaces widen, until the forest
you have been travelling under breaks into
beautiful clumps of trees, like those of a gentleman's
park, and every here and there are
placed clear pieces of water, spreading out
full of pond-turtle, and short grass, that
sparkles in the dew."</p>

<p>As you approach the town, the open spaces
become more frequent, until at length you
gain a rising ground, about three miles from
Panama, where the view is enchanting.
Below lies the city, and the broad Pacific,
dotted with ships, lies broad and glassy beyond.</p>

<p>Basil Hall, an accurate but less poetical
observer, sketches the bay of Panama, its
beach fringed with plantations shaded by
groves of oranges, figs, and limes, the tamarinds
surmounting all but the feathery tops
of the cocoa-nut trees; the ground hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
with foliage, among which peep cane-built
huts and canoes pulling to shore. Tavoga
he describes as a tangle of trees and flowers.
"The houses of the city, very curious and
magnificent," says Esquemeling, "and richly
adorned with paintings and hangings, of which
a part only had been removed." The buildings
were all stately, and the streets broad and
well arranged. There were within the walls
eight monasteries, a cathedral, and an hospital,
attended by the religious. The churches
and monasteries were richly adorned with
paintings, and in the subsequent fire may
have perished some of the masterpieces of
Titian, Murillo, or Velasquez. The gold plate
and fittings of these buildings the priests had
concealed. The number of rich houses was
computed at 2000, and the smaller shops, &amp;c.,
at 5000 additional. The grandest buildings
in the town were the Genoese warehouses
connected with the slave trade; there were
also long rows of stables, where the horses
and mules were kept that were used to convey
the royal plate from the South to the
North Pacific Ocean. Before the city, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
offerings spread before a throne, lay rich
plantations and pleasant gardens.</p>

<p>Panama was the city to which all the
treasures of Peru were annually brought.
The plate fleet, laden with bars of gold and
silver, arrived here at certain periods brimming
with the crown wealth, as well as that of
private merchants. It returned laden with
the merchandise of Panama and the Spanish
main, to be sold in Peru and Chili, and still
oftener with droves of negro slaves that the
Genoese imported from the coast of Guinea to
toil and die in the Peruvian mines. So wealthy
was this golden city that more than 2,000
mules were employed in the transport of the
gold and silver from thence to Porto Bello,
where the galleons were loaded. The merchants
of Panama were proverbially the
richest in the whole Spanish West Indies.
The Governor of Panama was the suzerain of
Porto Bello, of Nata, Cruz, Veragua, &amp;c., and
the Bishop of Panama was primate of the Terra
Firma, and suffragan to the Archbishop of
Peru. The district of Panama was the most
fertile and healthy of all the Spanish colonies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
rich in mines, and so well wooded that its
ship-timber peopled with vessels both the
northern and the southern seas; its land
yielded full crops, and its broad savannahs
pastured innumerable herds of wild cattle.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers found the booty in the
half-devastated town ample beyond their
expectations, in spite of all that had
been destroyed, buried, or removed. The
stores were still full of wealth, which not
even a month of alarm had given the merchants
time to remove to their overcharged
vessels. Some rooms were choked with corn,
and others piled high with iron, tools, plough-shares,
&amp;c., for Peru. In many was found
"metal more attractive," in the shape of
wine, olive oil, and spices, while silks, cloths,
and linen lay around in costly heaps.</p>

<p>Morgan, still afraid of surprise, resorted to
a reckless scheme to avert the danger. The
very night he entered Panama he set fire to a
few of the chief buildings, and before morning
the greater part of the city was in a flame,
although the first blaze had been detected
in the suburbs. No one knew his motive,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
and few that the enemy had not done it.
He carefully spread a report, both among
the prisoners and his own people, that the
Spaniards themselves were the authors of the
fire. The citizens and even the English
strove to extinguish the flames, by blowing
up some houses with gunpowder and pulling
down others, but being of wood, the fire
spread rapidly from roof to roof. In less
than half an hour a whole street was consumed.
The Genoese warehouses and many
of the slaves were burnt, and only one church
was left standing; 200 store buildings were
destroyed. &#338;xmelin seems to lament chiefly
the slaves and merchandise, and scarcely even
affects a regret for the stately city. The
ruins continued to smoke and smoulder for a
month, and at daybreak of the morning after
their arrival, little of the great city they had
lately seen glorious in the sunset remained
but the president's house, where Morgan and
his staff lodged, a small clump of muleteers'
cottages, and two convents, that of St. Joseph
and that of the Brothers of the Redemption.
Still fearful of surprise, the adventurers encamped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
outside the walls in the fields, from a
wish to avoid the confusion, and in order to
keep together in case of an attack by a
superior force. The wounded were put into
the only church that had escaped the fire.</p>

<p>The next day Morgan despatched 160 men
to Chagres to announce his victory, and to
see that his garrison wanted for nothing.
They met whole troops of Spaniards running
to and fro in the savannah, but, in spite of
their expectations, they never rallied. In
the afternoon the Buccaneers re-entered the
city, and selected houses of the few left to
barrack in. They then dragged all the available
cannon they could find and placed them
round the church of the Fathers of the Trinity,
which they entrenched. In this they placed
in separate places the wounded and the
prisoners. The evening they spent in searching
the ruins for gold, melted or hidden, and
found much spoil, especially in wells and
cisterns.</p>

<p>A few hours after, Morgan's vessels returned
with three prizes, laden with plate and other
booty, taken in the South Sea. The day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
they sailed, arriving at one of the small
islands of refuge near Panama, they took a
sloop with its crew of seven men, belonging
to a royal Spanish vessel of 400 tons, laden
with church plate and jewels, removed by
the richest merchants in Panama; there were
also on board all the religious women of the
nunnery, with the valuable ornaments of their
church, and she was so deeply laden as not
to require ballast. It carried only seven
guns and a dozen muskets, had no more sails
than the "uppermost of the mizen," was
short of ammunition and food, and even of
water. The Buccaneers received this intelligence
from some Indians who had spoken
to the seamen of the galleon when they
came ashore in a cock-boat for water. Had
they given chase they might have easily
captured it, but Captain Clark let the golden
opportunity slip through his hands. Thinking
himself sure of his prize as he had got
her sloop, his men spent the night in
drinking the rich wines they found in the
sloop, and reposing in the arms of their
Spanish mistresses, the more beautiful for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
tears and despair. During these debaucheries
the galleon slipped by and was no more seen,
and so they lost a prize of greater value than
all the treasure found in Panama. In the
morning, weary of the revel, they crowded
all sail and despatched a well-armed boat to
pursue the cripple, ascertaining that the
Spanish ship was in bad sailing order and
incapable of making any resistance. In the
islands of Tavoga and Tavogilla they captured
several boats laden with merchandise. Informed
by a prisoner of the probable moorings
of the galleon, Morgan, enraged at her escape,
sent every boat in Panama in pursuit of
her, bidding them seek till they found her.
They were eight days cruising from port to
creek. Returning to the isles, they found
here a large ship newly come from Payta,
laden with cloth, soap, sugar, biscuit, and
20,000 pieces of eight; another small boat
near was also taken and laden with the
divided merchandise. With these glimpses
of wealth the boats returned to Panama
somewhat consoled for the loss of their larger
prize. The Buccaneers' vessels now began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
excite the astonishment of the Spaniards,
they being the first Englishmen, since
Drake, who had appeared as enemies on those
seas.</p>

<p>During this expedition Morgan had employed
the rest of his men in scouring the
country in daily companies of 200, one party
relieving another, and perpetually bringing
in flocks of pale and bleeding prisoners, or
mules laden with treasure. Some tortured the
captives, others explored the mines, and the
rest burnt glittering heaps of gold and silver
stuffs, merely to obtain the metal, expecting to
have to fight their way back to their ships at
Chagres, and not wishing to be encumbered
with unwieldy bundles on that toilsome and
dangerous march. Morgan, complaining much
of the fruitless labours of his foragers, at last
placed himself at the head of 350 men, and
sallied into the country to torture every
wealthy Spaniard he could meet.</p>

<p>The following anecdote presents us with
such a complete picture of the demoralisation
of a panic, that it reminds us of Thucydides'
description of Athens during the plague, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Boccaccio's of Florence during the raging of
the pest. On one occasion Morgan's men met
with a poor Spaniard, who, during the general
confusion, had strolled into a rich man's house
and dressed himself in the costume of a
merchant of rank. He had just stripped off
his rags, and, first luxuriating in a change of
costly Dutch linen, had slipped on a pair of
breeches of fine red taffety, and picking up
the silver key of some coffer, had tied it to
one of his points. Esquemeling represents
the man as a poor retainer of the house. He
was still wondering childishly at his unwonted
finery, when the Buccaneers broke
into the house and seized him as a prize.
Finding him richly dressed and in a fine
house, they believed him at once to be the
master. His story they treated as a subtle
invention. In vain he pointed to the black
rags he had thrown off&mdash;in vain he protested,
by all the saints, that he lived on charity,
and had wandered in there and put on the
clothes by the merest chance, and without a
motive but of venial theft. Spying the little
key at his girdle they became sure that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
lied, and they demanded where he had hid
his cabinet. They had at first laughed at
his ingenious story&mdash;they now grew angry
at his denials of wealth. They stretched
him on the rack and disjointed his arms,
they twisted a cord round his wrinkled forehead
"till his eyes appeared as big as eggs,
and were ready to fall out," and as he still
refused to answer, they hung him up and
loaded him with stripes. They then cut
off his nose and ears, singing his face with
burning straw till he could not even groan
or scream, and at last, despairing of obtaining
a confession, gave him over to their attendant
band of negroes to put him to death with
their lances. "The common sport and recreation
of the pirates," says Esquemeling,
"being such cruelties."</p>

<p>They spared no sex, age, or condition;
priest or nun, peasant or noble, old man,
maiden, and child were all stretched on the
same bed of torture. They granted no
quarter to any who could not pay a ransom,
or who would not pay it speedily. The most
beautiful of the prisoners became their mistresses,
and the virtuous were treated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
rigour and cruelty. Captain Morgan himself
seduced the fairest by alternate presents
and threats. There were women found
base enough to forsake their religion and
their homes to become the harlots of a pirate
and a murderer. But to his iron heart
love found a way, and enervated the mind
of the man whom nothing before could soften.</p>

<p>After ten days spent in the country beyond
the walls, Morgan returned to Panama,
and found a shipload of Spanish prisoners
newly arrived. Amongst these was a woman
of exquisite beauty, the wife of a Spanish merchant,
then absent on business in Peru. He
had left her in the care of some relations, with
whom she was captured. Esquemeling says:
"Her years were few, and her beauty so great,
as, peradventure, I may doubt whether in
all Christendom any could be found to surpass
her perfections, either of comeliness or
honesty." &#338;xmelin, a more skilful observer,
and who saw her, being a sharer in the expedition,
describes her hair as ink black, and
her complexion of dazzling purity. Her eyes
were piercing, and the Spanish pride, usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
so cold and repulsive, served in her only as a
foil to her surpassing beauty, and to attract
respect. The roughest sailors and rudest
hunters grew eloquent when they praised her.
The common men would willingly have drawn
swords for such a prize. But their commander
was already the slave of her whom
he had captured. His demeanour changed:
he was no longer brutal and truculent: he
became sociable in manner, and more attentive
to the richness of his dress, for lovers
grow either more careless or more regardful
of their attire.</p>

<p>The Buccaneer's aspect was changed. He
separated the lady from the other prisoners,
and treated her with marked respect. An
old negress, who waited on her, served at
once as an attendant and a spy. She was
told to assure her mistress, that the Buccaneers
were gentlemen and no thieves, and
men who knew what politeness and gallantry
were as well as any. The lady wept and entreated
to be placed with the other prisoners,
for she had heard that her relations were
afraid of some plot against her good fame.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span></p>

<p>The lady, like other Spanish women, had
been told by their priests and husbands, that
the Buccaneers had the shape of beasts and
not of men. The more intelligent reported
they were robbers, murderers, and heretics;
men who forswore the Holy Trinity, and did
not believe in Jesus Christ. "The <i>oaths</i> of
<i>Morgan</i>," says Esquemeling, with most commendable
gravity, "<i>soon convinced her that
he had heard of a God</i>." It was said, that a
woman of Panama who had long desired to
see a pirate, on their first entrance into the
city cried out, "Jesu Maria, the thieves are
men, like the Spaniards, after all;" and some
volunteers, when they went out to meet Morgan's
army, had promised to bring home a
pirate's head as a curiosity.</p>

<p>Morgan, refusing to restore the beauty to
her friends, treated her with more flattering
care than before. Tapestries, robes, jewels,
and perfumes, lay at her disposal. Such
kindness, after all, was cheap generosity, and
part of this treasure may even have been her
husband's. In her innocence, she began to
think better of the Buccaneers. They might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
be thieves, but they were not, she found,
atheists, nor very cruel, for Captain Morgan
sent her dishes from his own table. She at
first received his visits with gratitude and
pleasure, surprised at the rough, frank kindness
of the seaman, and loudly denounced his
slanderers, that had so cruelly attempted to
poison her mind against him, her guardian
and protector. The snares were well set,
and the bird was fluttering in. But Heaven
preserved her, and she passed through the
furnace unhurt. Morgan soon threw off his
disguise, and offered her all the treasures of
the Indies if she would become his mistress.
She refused his presents of gold and pearl,
and resisted all his artifices. In vain he
tried alternately kindness and severity. He
threatened her with a thousand cruelties, and
she replied, that her life was in his hands,
but that her body should remain pure, though
her soul was torn from it. On his advancing
nearer, and threatening violence, she drew
out a poignard, and would have slain him or
herself, had he not left her uninjured. Enraged
at her pride, as he miscalled her virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
he determined to break her spirit by
suffering. She was stripped of her richest
apparel, and thrown into a dark cellar, with
scarcely enough food allowed her to support
life, and the chief demanded 30,000 piastres
as her ransom, to prevent her being sold as a
slave in Jamaica. Under this hardship the
lady prayed like a second Una daily to God,
for constancy and patience. Morgan, now convinced
of her purity, and afraid of his men,
who already began to express openly their
sympathy with her sufferings, to account for
his cruelty, accused her to his council of having
abused his kindness by corresponding
with the Spaniards, and declared that he had
intercepted a letter written in her own hand.
"I myself," says Esquemeling, "was an
eye-witness of the lady's sufferings, and could
never have judged such constancy and chastity
to be found in the world, if my own
eyes and ears had not assured me thereof."
Amid the blood, and dust, and vapour of
smoke, the virtue of this incomparable lady
shines out like a pale evening star, visible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
above all the murky crimson of an autumn
sunset.</p>

<p>A new danger now arose to Morgan from
this adventure, for the seamen began to
murmur, saying that the love of this beautiful
Spaniard kept them lingering at Panama,
and gave the Spaniards time to collect their
forces, and surprise them on their return.
But Morgan, having now stayed three weeks,
and nothing more being left to plunder, gave
orders to collect enough mules to carry the
spoil to Cruz, where it could be shipped for
Chagres, and so sent homeward.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that various causes
had for some time been undermining the
long subsisting attachment between Morgan
and his men. He had shown himself a slave
to the passions which enchained their own
minds, and their riches perhaps made them
independent, and therefore mutinous. It
was while the mules were collecting that he
became aware of the loaded mine over which
he stood. A plot was discovered, in which
there were 100 conspirators. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
resolved to seize the two vessels they had
captured in the South Sea, and with these to
take possession of an island, which they
could fortify for a stronghold. They would
then fit out the first large Spanish vessel
they could obtain, and with a good pilot
and a bold captain start privateering on
their own account, and work home by the
straits of Magellan. As the spoil had not
yet been divided, it is probable that all these
men had broken the Buccaneer oath, and had
secreted part of the plunder. They had
already hidden in private places, cannons,
muskets, provisions, and ammunition. They
were on the very point of raising the anchor,
when one of them betrayed the scheme, and
Morgan at once ordered the vessel to be dismasted
and the rigging burnt. The vessels
he would also have destroyed, but these he
spared at the intercession of the friend he had
appointed their captain. From this time all
confidence seems to have ceased between
Morgan and his men. Many a king has
been made a tyrant by the detection of a
conspiracy. The men dreaded his vengeance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
and he their treachery. From this hour he
appears to have resolved to enrich himself
and his immediate friends at any risk, leaving
the French to shift for themselves. It is not
improbable but that the old French and
English feud may have had something to
do with this quarrel. In war it ceased, but
rankled out again in peace. The French
seem to have been his greatest enemies, and
the English friendly or indifferent. This
distinction is visible even in the historians,
for Esquemeling speaks of him with mere
distrust, and &#338;xmelin with bitter hatred.</p>

<p>In a few days the mules were ready,
and the gold packed in convenient bales, for
Spanish or English gold it was all one to the
mules. The costly church plate was beaten
up into heavy shapeless lumps, and the
heavier spoil was left behind or destroyed.
Better burn it, they thought, than leave it
to the accursed Spaniard, for we always hate
those whom we have injured. The artillery
of the town being carefully spiked, and all
ready to depart, Morgan informed his prisoners
that he was about to march, and that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
should take with him all those who were either
unable or unwilling at once to bring in their
ransom. The sight was heart-rending, and
the panic general. At his words, says the
historian, there was not one but trembled,
not one but hurried to write to his father,
his brother, or his friends, praying for instant
deliverance or it would be too late. The
slaves were also priced, and hostages were sent
to collect the money. While this was taking
place, a party of 150 men were sent to Chagres
to bring up the boats and to look out for
ambuscades, it being reported that Don Juan
Perez de Guzman, the fugitive president of
Panama, had entrenched himself strongly at
Cruz, and intended to dispute the passage.
Some prisoners confessed that the president
had indeed so intended, but could get no
soldiers willing to fight, though he had sent
for men as far as Carthagena; for the scattered
troopers fled at the sight of even their
own friends in the distance.</p>

<p>Having waited four days impatiently for
the ransom, Morgan at last set out on his
return on the 24th of February, 1671. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
took with him a large amount of baggage,
175 beasts of burden laden with gold, silver,
and jewels, and about 600 prisoners, men,
women, children, and slaves, having first
spiked all the cannon and burnt the gun-carriages.
He marched in good order for
fear of attack, with a van and rear-guard,
and the prisoners guarded between the two
divisions.</p>

<p>The departure was an affecting sight, as
even the two historians, who were Buccaneers
themselves and eye-witnesses, admit. Lamentations,
cries, shrieks, and doleful sighs of
women and children filled the air. The men
wept silently, or muttered threats between
their teeth, to avoid the blows of their unpitying
drivers. Thirst and hunger added
to their sufferings. Many of the women
threw themselves on their knees at Morgan's
feet and begged that he would permit them
to return to Panama, there to live with their
dear husbands and children in huts till the
city could be rebuilt. But his fierce answer
was, that he did not come there to hear
lamentations, but to seek money, and that if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
that was not found, wherever it was hid, they
should assuredly follow him to Jamaica. All
the selfishness and all the goodness of each
nature now came to the surface. The selfish
fell into torpid and isolated despair&mdash;the
good forgot their own sufferings in trying to
relieve those of others.</p>

<p>Some gazed at each other silently and
hopelessly; others wailed and wept, a few
cursed and raged. Here stood one mourning
for a brother&mdash;there another lamenting a wife.
Many believed that they should never see
each other again; but would be sold as slaves
in Jamaica. The first evening the army
encamped in the middle of a green savannah
on the banks of a cool and pleasant river.
This was a great relief to the wretched
prisoners, who had been dragged all day
through the heat of a South American noon
by men themselves insensible to climate&mdash;urged
forward by the barrels of muskets and
blows from the butts of pikes. Some of the
women were here seen begging the Buccaneers,
with tears in their eyes, for a drop of water,
that they might moisten a little flour for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
children, who hung crying at their parched
and dried-up breasts. The next day, when
they resumed the march, the shrieks and
lamentations were more terrible than before.
"They would have caused compassion in the
hardest heart," says Esquemeling; "but Captain
Morgan, as a man little given to mercy,
was not moved in the least." The lagging
Spaniards were driven on faster with blows,
till some of the women swooned with the
intense heat, and were left as dead by the
road-side. Those who had husbands gave
them the children to carry. The young
and the beautiful fared best. The fair
Spaniard was led between two Buccaneers,
still apart from the rest. She wept as she
walked along, crying that she had entrusted
two priests in whom she relied to procure her
ransom money, 30,000 piastres, from a certain
hidden place, and that they had employed
it in ransoming their friends. A slave had
brought a letter to the lady and disclosed the
treachery. Her complaint being told to
Morgan he inquired into it, and found it
to be true. The religious men confessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
their crime, but declared they had only
borrowed the money, intending to repay it
in a week or so. He therefore at once
released the lady, and detained the monks
in her place, taking them on to Chagres
and despatching two men to obtain their
ransom.</p>

<p>On arriving at Cruz the mules were unloaded,
preparatory to embarkation. The
Buccaneers encamped round the king's warehouse,
where it was stored. Three days were
given to collect the ransom. The Spaniards,
tardy or unwilling in the collection, brought
in the money the day after. Vast quantities
of corn, rice, and maize were collected here
for victualling the ships. Morgan embarked
150 slaves, and a few poor and obstinate Spaniards
who had not yet paid their ransom. The
monks were redeemed, and escaped happy
enough. A part of the Buccaneers marched
by land. Many tears of joy and sorrow
were shed when the prisoners and those who
were liberated took farewell.</p>

<p>On reaching Barbacoa the division of the
spoil began. Mustering his men, Morgan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
compelled them all to swear they had concealed
nothing, even of the smallest value,
and, what was more unusual, he ordered them
all to be individually searched from top to
toe, down even to the very soles of their
shoes. This search was suspicious and insulting.
The Frenchmen, hot-blooded and
mutinous, would have openly resisted had
they not been in the minority. Morgan
allowed himself to be first searched to lessen
the general discontent, and one man in every
company was employed as searcher. No precautions
were neglected that could be suggested
by long experience of plundering.</p>

<p>This unusual vigilance was a mere cloak
for Morgan's own dishonesty. Every man
was now compelled to discharge his musket
before the searchers, that they might be sure
no precious stones were hidden in the barrel.
These searchers were generally the lieutenants
of each crew, and had all taken an additional
oath to perform their duty with fidelity. The
murmurs against Morgan had now reached
such a height, and were so hourly increasing,
that many Frenchmen threatened to take his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
life before they reached Jamaica. The more
temperate controlled the younger and the more
impetuous, and the band reached Chagres
without any revolt. They found the garrison
short of provisions and glad to be relieved,
but the wounded had nearly all died of
their wounds.</p>

<p>From Chagres Morgan sent a great boat
to Porto Bello with all the St. Catherine's
prisoners, and demanded a ransom for sparing
the castle of Chagres. The people of Porto
Bello replied they would not give one farthing,
and he might burn it as he chose.</p>

<p>The day after their arrival, Morgan divided
the booty. It amounted to only 443,000
pounds, estimating at ten piastres the pound.
The jewels were sold unfairly, the admiral
and his cabal buying the greater part very
cheap, having already, it was believed, retained
all the best of the spoil. Every one
had expected at least 1000 pieces each, and
was disappointed and indignant at receiving
only about 200. There was an end now
to all co-operation between English and
French adventurers, and the hopes of a Buccaneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
republic were at an end for ever.
The murmurs again rose incontrollably high,
and some proposed to seize Morgan and force
him to a fair division.</p>

<p>The suspected admiral, trying in vain to
pacify them, and finding he could obtain no
price for Chagres, divided the provisions of
the fort among the vessels, removed the
cannon and ammunition, then demolished
the fortifications, and burnt the buildings.
Suddenly taking alarm, or more probably
following a preconcerted plan, Morgan sailed
out of the harbour without any signal or
notice, and hurried to Jamaica, followed by
four English vessels, whose captains had been
his confidants.</p>

<p>In the first paroxysm of their rage, the
French adventurers would have pursued
Morgan, and attacked his vessel, but he
escaped while they were still hesitating. We
shall find him finally settled in Jamaica, and
married to the daughter of the chief person of
the island, a sure proof, says the indignant
and philosophical &#338;xmelin, that any one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
esteemed in this world provided he has
money.</p>

<p>The same vivacious writer gives a lively
picture of the rage of the crews at the treacherous
flight of Morgan. They shouted, swore,
stamped, clenched their fists, gnashed their
teeth, and tore their hair, fired off their pistols
in the air, and brandished their arms,
with imprecations loud and deep. They longed
for the plunder they had lost, and longed
still more eagerly for revenge. They never
now mentioned the Welsh name but with an
execration. Strange anomaly of the human
mind, that men who lived by robbery, should
be astonished at a small theft committed by
a comrade! In the first bitterness of their
vexation, they drew their sabres, and hewed
and thrust at their imaginary enemy. They
bared their arms, and pointed out to each
other the cicatrices of their half-healed
wounds.</p>

<p>Confirmations of the admiral's treachery
reached them from every side.</p>

<p>They remembered that Morgan had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
latterly unusually reserved and unsociable,
closeting himself with a few English confidants,
to whom he had been seen whispering
even during public conferences. He
had, it was now recollected, grown silent
during all discussions, and more particularly
when the booty was mentioned.</p>

<p>&#338;xmelin (a surgeon) also mentions, that
on one occasion, as he was visiting a wounded
Buccaneer, Morgan came up to the hammock,
and said in English, thinking he could not
be overheard, "Courage, get soon well, you
have helped me to conquer, and you must
help me to profit by the conquest." Another
day, as &#338;xmelin was searching by the river
for a medical herb, he turned round suddenly,
and saw Morgan secreting something in the
corner of a canoe, and looking frequently over
his shoulder to see if he was observed. When
he observed &#338;xmelin, he looked troubled,
and, coming up, asked him what he was doing
there, to which the surgeon made no answer,
but, stooping down, picked the plant he
was in search of, and began to tell him its
properties. Morgan turned off the subject,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
beginning to converse on indifferent topics,
and, although the proudest of men, insisted
on accompanying him home. &#338;xmelin took
care to find an opportunity afterwards to
rummage the canoe, but found nothing; but
this same canoe he always observed Morgan
took great care of, and never permitted to
row out of his sight. But these stories none
had dared to utter, for since the victory of
Panama, the admiral, always proud, sensual,
and cruel, had grown every day more stern,
and had rendered himself dreaded by his
severities.</p>

<p>The adventurers sought for a long time
some means of avenging themselves on Morgan
for his successful treachery. They at last
heard that he had resolved to take possession
of St. Catherine's island, being apprehensive
of the governor of Jamaica. In this spot he
had determined to fortify himself, renew his
Buccaneering, and defy both open enemies and
treacherous friends. The Buccaneers agreed
to waylay him on his passage, and carry him
off, with his wife, children, and ill-gotten
treasure. They then planned either to kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
him, or compel him to render an account of
the spoil of Panama. But an unexpected
accident saved Morgan, and defeated their
scheme of vengeance. At the very crisis,
a new governor, Lord G. Vaughan, arrived
at Port Royal, and brought a royal order for
Morgan to be sent to England to answer the
complaints of the King of Spain and his subjects.
Of his trial we hear nothing, but we
soon after see the culprit knighted by Charles
II., and appointed Commissioner of Admiralty
for Jamaica. The king, who frolicked with
Rochester, and smiled at the daring villany
of Blood, had no scruples in disgracing
knighthood by such an addition.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1680, the Earl of Carlisle,
then governor of Jamaica, finding his
constitution undermined by the climate, returned
to England, leaving Morgan as his
deputy.</p>

<p>His opportunity of revenge had now come,
and he remembered his old dangers of ruin
and assassination. Many of the Buccaneers
were hung by his authority, and some of them
were delivered up to the governor of Carthagena.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
A new governor arrived, and terminated
his cruelties, and the justice inspired
by a personal hatred. He still remained commissioner.
In the next reign he was thrown
into prison, where he remained three years.
Of his final fate we know nothing certain.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>On the departure of Morgan, the Buccaneers,
without food, and without leaders,
underwent many sufferings, and remained
uncertain what to do.</p>

<p>&#338;xmelin and a few of his French friends
being informed by a female slave that an old
Buccaneer lived in the neighbourhood, determined
to go to him and barter goods, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
they were told that, although a Spaniard,
such was his custom. Following the slave
with great expectation, they reached the
veteran's fort after about six hours' march.
The Buccaneers' "peel" towers were scattered
all over the West Indies, and Waterton mentions
seeing the ruins of one near Demerara.
This fort was defended by a fosse of immense
depth, and by massy walls of an extraordinary
thickness, flanked at each corner by
a bastion well supplied with cannon. The
Frenchmen displayed their colours and beat
their drums as a greeting, yet no one appeared,
and no one answered; but, at the
end of a quarter of an hour, they saw a light
in one of the bastions, and perceived a man
about to discharge a cannon. Throwing
themselves on their faces with professional
dexterity, the shot flew over their heads,
and they then rose and retreated out of range.
Believing at once that they had been betrayed,
for many dangers had made them
suspicious, they were about to cut their guide
to pieces, when, running from them, she cried
to the gunner, "Why is your master false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
to his word? did he not promise to receive
these gentlemen?" "It is true," cried the
soldier, "but he has changed his mind; and
if you and your people do not go off, I will
blow out your brains." The Buccaneers,
enraged at the insolence of this threat, and
the capricious change of intention, were about
to attempt to storm the place, when four
Spaniards advanced and demanded a truce, in
the name of their master. "We had," they
explained, "been alarmed at your numbers,
and feared foul play or treachery."
The old adventurer was now willing to receive
them, if they would send four of their
band as ambassadors and hostages. &#338;xmelin
was one of the four chosen. They found the
old man, grey and venerable, seated between
two others. He was so old and feeble that
he could not speak audibly, but he smiled
and moved his lips, and stroked his long
white beard, as they entered, and they could
observe that he was pleased to see once more
the well-remembered dress of the Buccaneer
seamen. His majestic bearing was impressive.
Though he could not rise to welcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
them, he bent his head in answer to their
greetings, and beckoned to one of his attendants
to speak for him. By his orders they
were at once taken to his store-rooms, where
they bartered their goods, and obtained all
that they required. They first eagerly selected
some brandy, and &#338;xmelin is never
tired of repeating "ses gens l'aiment avec
passion." On their way back to the ships
with the guide, delighted at their success,
the Spaniards who carried the goods they had
bought told them their master's history. He
was, it appeared, properly speaking, neither
an adventurer nor a Castilian, but a Portuguese,
who had lived long both with adventurers
and with Spaniards. A Spanish ship
had picked him up in a drifted canoe when
quite a boy, and he had been employed
among the slaves in a cocoa plantation, where
he soon became a successful steward, and
much beloved by his master. His patron
sent every year a vessel to his plantation to
be loaded with cocoa. One day, as the
steward was on board superintending the
lading, a sudden squall came on, snapped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
the cable, and drove them out to sea. He
being a good pilot, and accustomed to navigation,
attempted to put back to land as soon
as the storm abated, but the slaves, with one
voice, declared that they would not return, and
that he should not take them, for they knew
that their master would suspect, and would
cruelly punish them. At that time the
slightest offence of a slave was punished
with death. The steward remonstrated with
them; but the slaves resolved to be free,
although they knew not where to steer. At
this crisis the bark was pursued by a Buccaneer
vessel, from which a storm for a short
time released them, but they were eventually
overtaken and captured.</p>

<p>The Buccaneer captain brought these prisoners
to the fortress they had just visited.
Here he became again a faithful steward,
and finally inherited the place at his master's
death, and continued to trade with the Buccaneers,
as his predecessor had done. The
fortress had been originally built to repel
the Spaniards, who had been several times
beaten off with loss.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>It is very seldom that we can follow the
Buccaneer to the last scene of all: he flashes
across our scene from darkness to darkness,
and we hear of him no more. In the present
instance, &#338;xmelin enables us to fill up the
vacuum and tell out the tale. In a subsequent
voyage he returned to the old spot, the
scene of an oft told story. Devastation had
fallen upon the devastator, the fortress was
completely demolished and no dwelling remained.
He ascertained from the Spaniards
that the old man had died and left his riches to
his two sons, who, impatient of a slothful
wealth, and with imaginations excited from
their youth by the recital of Buccaneer adventures,
had at last turned Flibustiers. Before
their father's death they had often expressed
a wish to conquer the country of the ferocious
Bravo Indians, but he had always discouraged
them from the dangerous and unprofitable
expedition, being afraid of attacks from the
Spaniards in their absence. They were
never heard of again, but report was current
that, having been shipwrecked, the two Buccaneers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
had been taken by the Indians, and
killed and eaten.</p>

<p>Leaving the Boca del Toro, about thirty
leagues distant from Chagres, &#338;xmelin and
his companions arrived at the country of the
very dreaded Bravo Indians. These people
were known to be warlike cannibals, cruel
and very treacherous. They were expert
archers, and could discharge their arrows, like
the Parthians, even when in full retreat.
They had axes and spears, and wore metal
ornaments, the clash of which animated them
to the charge. They carried tortoise-shells
for shields, which covered their whole bodies,
and were most to be dreaded when few in
number and quite overpowered, for they
would then throw themselves like wild-cats
on the foe, and think only of destroying their
enemy's life, regardless of their own. Morgan,
who seems to have made every preparation
for an extensive Buccaneer empire, had often
sworn to totally destroy this nation which
had slain so many shipwrecked men, and
so frequently frustrated his plans. No Buccaneer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
historian ever seems to have reflected
that these savages, rude as they were, fought
as patriots defending their country. We sing
of Tell and rave of Wallace, but we have no
interest in a hero without breeches!</p>

<p>These Indians had at first been friendly to
the Buccaneers, who had sold them iron in
exchange for food, but on one fatal occasion,
at a Buccaneer debauch, a quarrel had arisen,
and some Indians had been killed and their
wives carried off. From this time irreconcilable
hatred existed between the two
people, and to be wrecked on the Bravo shore
was equivalent to certain death. On reaching
Cape Diego (so called, like many other points
of land, from an old adventurer), &#338;xmelin
was compelled by hunger to feed on crocodile
eggs, which were found buried in the sand.
Meeting here with some French adventurers,
they all removed to an adjacent spot, where
they caught turtle and salted it for the
voyage.</p>

<p>Ascending a river to obtain provisions,
they surprised and killed two Indians, of
whom one had a beard-case of tortoise-shell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
and another of beaten gold: the latter they
took for a chief. Putting off from here, and
meeting with contrary winds that drove them
from Jamaica, they returned again to Chagres,
and were pursued by a ship of Spanish
build, which they feared had been sent from
Carthagena to rebuild the fort.</p>

<p>They attempted in vain to escape, and
were clearing the decks, preparing to fight
to the last, when the enemy hoisted the red
flag, and proved to be one of their companions'
vessels driven back by the <i>bise</i>, or
north-east wind. They lost two days' sail by
this accident, more than they could regain
in a fortnight, and returned to the Boca del
Toro to get provisions and kill sea-cows, and
then passed on to the Boca del Drago. The
islands here they knew to be inhabited, for
the fragrance of the fruits was wafted on the
sea wind. One day a fishing party gave
chase to two Indians in a canoe, which they
instantly drew ashore and carried with them
into the woods. This boat, weighing above
2,000 lbs. and requiring 11 men afterwards
to launch it, was made of wild cedar, roughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
hewn; being nimble the savages both escaped
the Buccaneers. A pilot who had been often
in those parts, told them that a few years
before, a Buccaneer squadron arriving in
that place, the men went in canoes to catch
the humming birds that swarmed round the
flowering trees of the coast. They were
observed by some Indians who had hid themselves
in the trees, who, leaping down into
the sea, carried off the boats and men before
their companions could arrive to their aid.
The admiral instantly landed 800 men to
rescue the prisoners, but so many Indians
collected that they found it necessary to
retreat in haste to their ships.</p>

<p>The next day the Buccaneers arrived at
Rio de Zuera, but the Spaniards were all fled,
leaving no provisions; they therefore filled
their boats with plantains, coasting for a
fortnight along the shore to find a convenient
place to careen, for the vessel had now grown
so leaky that slaves and men were obliged to
work night and day at the pumps. Arriving
at a port, called the Bay of Blevelt, from a
Buccaneer who used to resort there, half the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
crew were employed to unload and careen
the bark on the shore, and half to hunt in
the woods&mdash;still much afraid of the Indians,
though they had as yet seen none.</p>

<p>The huntsmen shot several porcupines of
great size, and many monkeys and pheasants.
The men took great pleasure in the midst of
their danger in this pursuit. They laughed
to see the females carrying their little ones
on their backs, just like the negro women,
and they admired the love and fidelity
which some showed when their friends were
wounded, and were delighted when they
pelted their pursuers with fruit and dead
boughs. The men were obliged to shoot
fifteen or sixteen to secure three or four, as
even when dead they remained clinging to
the trees, and remained so for several days,
hanging by their fore-paws or their tails.
When one was wounded the rest came chattering
round him, and would lay their paws on
the wound to stop the flow of blood, and others
would gather moss from the tress to bandage
the place, or, gathering certain healing herbs,
chew them and apply them as a poultice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
If a mother was killed the young ones would
not leave the body till they were torn away.</p>

<p>But these amusements were soon to come to
an end. The Indians were upon their track.
They had been now eight days hunting. It
was the daybreak of the ninth day, and the
fishermen and hunters were preparing their
nets and guns to start for the sea and for the
woods. The slaves were on the beach burning
shells to make lime, which served instead
of pitch for the vessels, and the women were
drawing water at the wells which had been
dug in the shore. A few of them were washing
dishes, and others sewing, for they had risen
earlier than usual. While the rest went to
the wells, one of them lingered behind to
pick some fruit that grew near the beach.
Seeing suddenly some Indians running from
the spot where she had left her companions,
she ran to the tents, crying, "Indians, Indians,
Christians, the Indians are come."
The Buccaneers, running to arms, discovered
that three of their female slaves were lying
dead in the wood, pierced with fourteen or
fifteen flint-headed arrows. These darts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
about eight feet long, and as thick as a man's
thumb; at one end was a wooden hook, tied
on with a string, at the other, a case containing
a few small stones. Searching the
woods, no traces of Indians, or any canoes,
were to be found, and the Buccaneers, fearing
they should be surrounded and overpowered,
re-embarked all their goods, and
sailed in great haste and fear.</p>

<p>They soon arrived at Cape Gracias à Dios,
and rejoiced to find themselves once more
among friendly Indians; and at a port where
Buccaneer vessels often resorted, the rudest
sailors giving thanks to God for having
delivered them out of so many dangers, and
brought them to a place of refuge. The
Indians provided them with every necessary,
and treated them with friendship. For an
old knife or hatchet the men each bought an
Indian woman, who supplied them with food.
These people often went to sea with the
Buccaneers, and, remaining several years, returned
home with a good knowledge of French
and English. They were used as fishermen,
and for striking tortoises and manitees, one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
Indian being able to victual a vessel of 100
men. &#338;xmelin's crew having on board two
sailors who could speak the Indian tongue,
they were unusually well received.</p>

<p>This nation was not more than 1700
in number, including a few negro slaves,
who had swum ashore from a wreck, having
murdered the Spanish crew, and, in their ignorance
of navigation, stranded the vessel.
Some of them cultivated the ground, and
others wandered about hunting and fishing.
They wore little clothes but a palm leaf hat,
and a short apron, made of the bark of some
tree. Their arms were spears, pointed with
crocodile's teeth. They believed in a Supreme
Being, and, as Esquemeling quaintly
says, "believe not in nor serve the devil, as
many other nations of America do, and hereby
they are not so much tormented by him as
other nations are." Their food was chiefly
fruit and fish. They prepared pleasant and
intoxicating liquors from the plantain, and
from the seed of the palm, and at their banquets
every guest was expected to empty a
four-quart calabash full of achioc, as the palm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
drink was called, merely a whet to the feast
to follow. Their achioc was as thick as gruel.
When they were in love, they pierced themselves
with arrows to prove their sincerity.
When a youth wished to marry a maiden,
the first question of the bride's father to the
lover was, whether he could make arrows, or
spin the thread with which they bound them.
If he answered in the affirmative, the father
called for a calabash of achioc, and he himself,
the bride, and the bridegroom, all tasted of
the beverage. When one of these hardy
women was delivered, she rose, went to the
nearest brook, washed and swathed the
child, and went about her ordinary labour.
When a husband died, the wife buried him,
with all his spears, aprons, and ear jewels,
and for fifteen moons after (a year) brought
meat and drink daily to the grave. Some
writers contend that the devil visited the
graves, and carried away these offerings to
the manes; but Esquemeling says, he knows
to the contrary, having often taken away the
food, which was always of the choicest and
best sort. At the end of the year, an extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
custom prevailed. The widow had
then to open the grave, and take out all the
bones; she scraped, washed, and dried them
in the sun; then placed them in a satchel,
and for a whole year was obliged to
carry them upon her back by day, and sleep
upon them by night. At the end of the
year, she hung up the bag at her door-post,
or, if she was not mistress of her house, at
the door of her nearest relation. A widow
could not marry again till this painful ceremony
was completed, and if an Indian woman
married a pirate, the same custom prevailed.
The negroes maintained the habits of their
own countries.</p>

<p>After refreshing themselves in this friendly
region, the Buccaneers steered for the island
de los Pinos, and, arriving in fifteen days,
refitted their vessel, now become dangerously
leaky. Half the crew were employed in
careening, and half in fishing, and by the
help of some of the Cape Gracias Indians
who accompanied them they killed and salted
a sufficient number of wild cattle and turtle
to revictual the ship. In six hours they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
could capture fish sufficient for a thousand
persons. "This abundance of provision,"
says Esquemeling, "made us forget the miseries
we had lately endured, and we began
to call one another again by the name of
<i>brother</i>, which was customary among us, but
had been disused in our miseries." They
feasted here plentifully, and without fear of
enemies, for the few Spaniards who were on
the island were friendly, and past dangers
grew mere dreams in the distance. Their
only anxiety now was about the crocodiles,
which swarmed in the island, and, when
hungry, would devour men.</p>

<p>On one occasion a Buccaneer and his negro
slave, while hunting in the wood, were attacked
by one of these monsters. With
incredible agility it fastened upon the Englishman's
leg, and brought him to the ground.
The negro fled. The hunter, a robust and
courageous man, drawing his knife, stabbed
the crocodile to the heart, after a desperate
fight, and then, tired with the combat and
weak with loss of blood, fell senseless by its
side. The negro, returning, from curiosity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
rather than compassion, to see how the duel
had ended, lifted his master on his back and
brought him to the sea-shore, a whole league
distant, where he placed him in a canoe and
rowed him aboard. After this, no Buccaneer
dared to go into the woods alone, but the
next day, sallying out in troops, they killed
all the monsters they could meet. These
animals would come every night to the sides
of the vessel and attempt to climb up, attracted
probably by the smell of food. One of
these, when seized with an iron hook, instead
of diving or swimming, began to mount the
ladder of the ship, till they killed him with
blows of pikes and axes. After remaining
some time here they sailed for Jamaica, and arrived
there in a few days after a prosperous
voyage, being the first adventurers who had
arrived there from Panama since Morgan.</p>

<p>In 1673, when the war between the French
and Hollanders (Dutch) was still raging, the
inhabitants of the French West Indian colonies
equipped a fleet to attack the Dutch
settlements at Curaçoa, engaging all the Buccaneers
that could be induced to join the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
white flag, either from hopes of plunder or
from hatred to the Dutch. M. D'Ogeron, the
Governor of Tortuga, the planner of this
invasion, headed the fleet in a large vessel
named after himself, built by himself, and
manned by 500 picked adventurers. His
unlucky star led them to misfortune. The
new frigate ran upon the rocks near the
Guadanillas Islands, and broke into a thousand
pieces, during a storm near Porto Rico. Being
at the time very near to land, the governor
and all his men swam safe to shore. The
next day, discovered by the Spaniards, they
were attacked by a large force, who supposed
they had come purposely to plunder the islands
as the Buccaneers had done before. The whole
country, alarmed, rose in arms. The shipwrecked
men were surrounded by an overpowering
army, who, finding them almost
without arms, refused to give them quarter,
slew the greater part without mercy, and
made the remainder prisoners. Binding them
with cords, two by two, they drove them
through the woods into the open champaign.
To all inquiries as to the fate of their commander,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
whom they could not distinguish
from the rest, they replied that he had sunk
with the wreck. D'Ogeron, following up this
deception with French sagacity, behaved
himself as a mere half-witted suttler, diverting
the Spanish soldiers by his tricks and
mimicry, and was the only Buccaneer whom
they allowed to go at liberty. The troopers
at their camp fires gave him scraps from their
meals and rewarded him with more food than
his companions.</p>

<p>Among the prisoners there was also a
French surgeon who had on former occasions
done some service to the Spaniards, and him
they also allowed to go at large. D'Ogeron
agreed with him to attempt an escape at all
risks, and after mature deliberation, they both
agreed upon a plan, and succeeded in escaping
safely into the woods, and in making
their way to the sea-side. They determined
to attempt to build a canoe, although unsupplied
with any tool except a hatchet. By
the evening they reached the sea-shore, to
their great joy, and caught some shell fish on
the beach from a shoal that ran in upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
sands in pursuit of their prey. Fire to roast
them they obtained by rubbing two sticks
together in the Indian fashion. The next
morning early they began to cut down and
prepare timber to build the canoe in which
to escape to Vera Cruz. While they were
toiling at their work they observed in the
distance a large boat, which they supposed
to contain an enemy, steering directly towards
them. Retreating to the woods, they discovered
as soon as it touched land that it
held only two poor fishermen. These unsuspecting
men they determined if possible to
overpower, and to capture the boat. As the
mulatto came on shore alone, with a string of
calabashes on his back to draw water, they
killed him with a blow of their axe, and
then slew the Spaniard, who, alarmed at the
sound of voices, was attempting in vain to
push from the shore. Having filled the dead
man's calabashes they set sail, using the
precaution of taking the dead bodies with
them out into the deep sea, in order to conceal
their death from the Spaniards.</p>

<p>They steered at once for Porto Rico, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
passed on to Hispaniola. A fair wind soon
brought them to Samana, where they found
a party of their people. Leaving the surgeon
to collect men at Samana, D'Ogeron sailed
to Tortuga to collect vessels and crews to
return and deliver his companions, and revenge
his late disaster. He sailed eventually
with 300 men, and took great precautions to
prevent the Spaniards being aware of his
coming, using only his lower sails in order
that his masts should not rise above the
horizon. In spite of this the Spaniards, informed
of his approach, had placed troops of
horse upon the shore at various assailable
points.</p>

<p>D'Ogeron landed his men under favour of
a discharge from his great guns, which drove
the horsemen into the woods, where, as he
little suspected, the infantry lay in ambush.
Eagerly pursuing, his men, who thought the
victory their own, found themselves hemmed
in on every side. Few escaped even to the
ships. The Spaniards, cruel from the reaction
of fear, cut off the limbs of the dead and
carried them home as trophies. They lighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
bonfires on the shore as tokens of defiance to
the retreating fleet.</p>

<p>The first prisoners were now treated worse
than ever. Some of them were sent to
Havannah and employed on the fortifications
all day, and chained up like wild beasts at
night to prevent their desperate attempts at
escape. Many were sent to Cadiz, and from
thence escaped over the Pyrenees into France,
and, assembling together, like sworn members
of a common brotherhood, returned by the
first ship to Tortuga.</p>

<p>These very men some time after equipped
a small fleet, under command of Le Sieur
Maubenon, which sacked Trinidad, and put
the island to a ransom of 10,000 pieces of
eight, and from thence proceeded to the
Caraccas.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers fought against the Dutch,
in 1676, and helped the French to recover
Cayenne, that had been taken by Vice-Admiral
Binkes. After this conquest, M. D'Estrees
attacked Tobago, but was repulsed with the
loss of 150 killed, and 200 wounded. His
ship, the <i>Glorieux</i>, of seventy guns, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
blown up, and two others stranded; several
of the Dutch vessels were, however, burnt.</p>

<p>D'Estrees, returning to Brest, was ordered
back to Tobago, with twenty sail of vessels
of war, besides a great number of small
craft. 1500 men were landed, and, approaching
a fortified place called Le Cort, summoned
Heer Binkes to surrender. The French began
their attack by throwing fire-balls into
the castle; the third grenade fell upon some
loose powder in the path leading to the magazine,
and blew it up. Heer Binkes and all
his officers but one were killed. 500 French
instantly stormed the works, killing all but
300 men, who were sent prisoners to France.
D'Estrees then destroyed every fort and house
in the island, and sailed away.</p>

<p>It was in 1678 that the same Comte
D'Estrees collected 1200 Buccaneers from
Hispaniola, and twenty vessels of war, besides
fire-ships, to capture Curaçoa, which
could have been taken with 300 Buccaneers
and three vessels. This fleet was, however,
lost on the Isles d'Aves, as we shall describe
in Dampier's voyage.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span></p>

<p>In the year 1678, Captain Cook loaded
his vessel with logwood, at Campeachy, and,
while anchoring at the island of Rubia, on
his way to Tobago, was captured by three
Spanish men-of-war, who left his crew upon
the shore, and carried off his ship and cargo.
They had not lain there long before a Spanish
sloop of sixteen men arrived, laden with
cocoa and plate, and gave them opportunity for
escape and for revenge. Borrowing muskets
of the Dutch governor, they employed six of
their men in seizing the sloop's boat as it
came to land, and then embarked and took
the larger vessel, leaving their prisoners
bound upon the beach, to watch the combat
that would decide their fate. Two men navigated,
two more loaded the guns, and two
others fired into the enemy as fast as they
could pour their shot into the stern-ports.
The Spaniards resisted stoutly for some time,
but, seeing their priest and captain shot dead,
threw their arms overboard, and cried for
quarter. The Buccaneers gave the Dutch
governor a handsome reward, with a recompence
for the arms, and divided among themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
about £4,000 worth of plate. On
arriving at Jamaica they burnt the prize,
and embarked their goods for England.</p>

<p>In the year of our Lord 1679, a Buccaneer
fleet of five sail, commanded by Captains
Coxen, Essex, Alliston, Rose, and
Sharp, set sail from Port-Royal, and steered
for the island of Pines, losing two vessels
in their passage, at the Zamballos islands.
They met a French ship, whose commission
was only for three months, and showed its captain,
with great exultation, their forged commission
for three years, purchased for only ten
pieces of eight.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span></p>

<p>The cruises of Sawkins and Sharp are
recorded in the travels of Ringrose, who
was present at all their exploits. At this
time the Buccaneers widened their field of
operations, and passed from the South into
the North Pacific. The whole coast of South<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
America, on either side, met the fate of the
West Indian islands. The gold mines of
Peru were the next object of their speculation.</p>

<p>A fleet which took Porto Bello a second
time rendezvoused at Boca del Toro. A
new expedition was then formed to follow
Captain Bournano, a French commander,
who had lately attacked Chepo, to Tocamora,
a great and very rich place, whither the
Darien Indians had offered to conduct him,
in spite of a late treaty with the Spaniards.</p>

<p>The vessels first dispersed into coves and
creeks to careen and salt turtle, and then reunited
at the Water key. The fleet consisted
of nine vessels, with a total of 22 guns and
458 men, in the following order:&mdash;Captain
Coxen, a ship of 80 tons, with 8 guns, and
197 men; Captain Harris, 150 tons, 5 guns,
and 107 men; Captain Bournano, 90 tons,
6 guns, and 86 men; Captain Sawkins, 16
tons, 1 gun, and 35 men; Captain Sharp,
25 tons, 2 guns, and 40 men; Captain Cook,
35 tons, and 43 men; Captain Alleston, 18
tons, and 24 men; Captain Row, 20 tons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
and 25 men; Captain Macket, 14 tons, and
20 men.</p>

<p>The expedition sailed March 26, 1679.
The first place to touch at was the Zemblas
Islands, where they traded with the friendly
Indians, who brought fruits and venison in
exchange for beads, needles, knives, and
hatchets. These Indians were quite naked,
but richly decorated with gold and silver
plates of a crescent form, and gold rings
worn in the nose, which they had to lift up
when they drank. They were generally
painted with streaks of black and red, but
were a handsome race, and frequently as fair
as Europeans. The sailors believed that they
could see better by night than by day.</p>

<p>The Indians dissuaded the captains from
the march upon Tocamora, and agreed to
guide them to the vicinity of Panama. The
way to Tocamora, they declared, was mountainous
and uninhabited, and ran through
wild places, where no provisions could be
obtained. In this change of plan, Row and
Bournano, whose crews were all French, separated,
being unwilling to risk a long march<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
by land, and remained at the Zemblas, while
Andræas, an Indian chief, guided the remaining
vessels to the Golden Island, a little
to the westward of the mouth of the great
river of Darien. There the seven remaining
vessels rendezvoused April 3, 1680.</p>

<p>They here agreed to follow the Indians'
advice, and attack the town of Santa Maria,
situated on the river of the same name,
which runs into the South Sea by the gulf
of St. Miguel. It was garrisoned by 400
soldiers, and from hence the gold gathered
in the neighbouring mountains was carried
to Panama, on which they could march if
they could not find enough at Santa Maria.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April they landed 331 men,
leaving Captains Alleston and Macket to
guard the ships in their absence. Each man
carried with him three or four "dough-boys"
(cakes), trusting to the rivers for drink.
Captain Sharp, who went at their head, was
still faint from a late sickness. His company
carried a red flag and a bunch of white and
green ribbons. The second division, led by
Captain Richard Sawkins, had a red flag,
striped with yellow. Captain Peter Harris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
with the third and fourth divisions, had two
green flags; Captain John Coxen, two red
flags; while Captain Edmund Cook bore red
colours, striped with yellow, with a hand
and sword for the device. All the men
carried fusees, pistols, and hangers.</p>

<p>The Indian guides led them through a
wood and over a bay two leagues up a
woody valley, along a good path, with here
and there old plantations. At a river, then
nearly dry, they built huts to rest in. Another
Indian chief, a man "of great parts," and
called Captain Antonio, now promised to be
their leader, as soon as his child, who was
then sick, had died, which he expected would
be next day. This Indian warned them
against lying in the grass, which was full of
large snakes.</p>

<p>The men, breaking some of the stones
washed down from the mountains, found
them glitter like gold; but, in spite of this,
several grew tired and returned to the ships,
leaving only 327 sailors and six Indian
guides.</p>

<p>The next day they ascended a very steep
hill, and found at the foot of it a river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
on which Andræas told them Santa Maria
was built. About noon they ascended another
and higher mountain, by so perpendicular and
narrow a path that only one man could pass at
a time. Having marched eighteen miles, they
halted that night on the banks of the same
river, much rain falling during both nights.
The next day they crossed the river, after
wading sometimes up to the knee, sometimes
to the middle, in a steep current. At noon
they reached the Indian village, near which
the king of Darien resided. The houses
were neatly built of cabbage-tree, with the
roofs of wild canes, thatched with palmito
royal, and were surrounded by plantain
walks; they had no upper storeys. The king,
queen, and family, came to visit them in
royal robes. Like most savages, he was all
ornament and nakedness, gold and dirt. His
crown was made with woven white reeds,
lined with red silk. In the middle was a
thin plate of gold, some beads, and several
ostrich feathers; in each ear a gold ring;
and in his nose a half-moon of the same
metal. His robe was of thin white cotton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
and in his hand he held a long bright lance,
sharp as a knife. The queen wore several red
blankets, and her two marriageable daughters
and young child were loaded with coloured
beads, and covered with strips of rag. The
women seemed "free, easy, and brisk," but
modest and afraid of their husbands. The
king gave the sailors each three plantains
and some sugar-canes to suck, but, after that
regal munificence, did not disdain to sell his
stores like his subjects, who proved very
cunning dealers in their purchases of knives,
pins, and needles. Resting here a day, Captain
Sawkins was appointed to lead the
forlorn hope of eighty men. Their march
still lay along the river, and here and there
they found a house. The Indians, standing
at the doors, would present each with a ripe
plantain or cassave root, or count them by
dropping a grain of millet for each one that
passed. They rested at night at some native
houses.</p>

<p>The next day Sharp, Coxen, and Cook,
and ninety men, embarked in fourteen canoes
to try how far the stream was navigable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
Captain Andræas being with them, and two
Indians in each canoe serving as guides. But
the water proved more tedious than the land;
for at the distance of every stone's-cast, they
were constrained to get out of the boats and
haul them over sands, rocks, or fallen trees,
and sometimes over spits of land. That
night they built huts on the bank, being
worn out with fatigue.</p>

<p>The next day proved a repetition of the
past; at night a tiger came near them, but
they dared not fire for fear of alarming the
Spaniards. The following day was worse than
before, and their men grew mutinous and
suspicious of the Indians, who, they thought,
had divided the troop in order to betray
them. The fourth day, resting on "a beachy
point of land," where another arm joined the
river, they were joined by their companions,
whom they had sent their Indians to seek,
and who had grown alarmed at their continued
absence. That night they prepared
their arms for action. On the morrow they
re-embarked, in all sixty-eight canoes and
327 Englishmen, with fifty Indian guides.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
They made themselves paddles, threw away
the Indian poles, and rowed with all speed,
meeting several boats laden with plantains.
About midnight they arrived within half-a-mile
of Santa Maria, and landed. The mud
was so deep that they had to lay down their
paddles and lift themselves up by the boughs
of the trees; then cutting a way through the
woods, they took up their lodging there for
the night, hoping to surprise the Spaniards.</p>

<p>At daybreak, to their disappointment, they
were awoke by the discharge of a musket
and the beating of a drum. The Spaniards
had already prepared some lead for their
reception, and had sent away their gold to Panama.
Directly they emerged into the plain,
the enemy ran into a large palisaded fort,
twelve feet high, and began to fire quick and
close. The vanguard, running up, pulled
down part of the stockade and broke in and
took them prisoners, the whole 280 men.
A few English were wounded, not one being
killed of the fifty men who led the attack.
200 other Spaniards were in the mines conveying
away the gold, the mines there being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
the richest of the western world. Twenty-six
Spaniards were killed in the fort and sixteen
wounded, but the governor, priest, and chief
men all escaped by flight. The town proved
to be merely a few cane houses, built to
check the Indians, who frequently rebelled.
Some days before, three cwt. of gold had
been sent in a bark to Panama, the same quantity
being despatched twice or thrice a-year.</p>

<p>During the fight the Indians, frightened
at the whistling of the bullets, had hid themselves
in a hollow; when all was over they
entered the place, with great courage stabbing
the prisoners with their lances, and putting
about twenty to death in the woods, till the
Buccaneers interfered. In the town the
Indians found the eldest daughter of the
Darien king, whom one of the garrison had
carried off, and who was then with child by
him. Rather than be left to the mercy of
the Indians, this man offered to lead them to
Panama, where they hoped to capture all the
riches of Potosi and Peru. Sawkins in a
canoe attempted in vain to overtake the
governor and his officers, and rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
return empty-handed, resolved to go to
Panama, to satisfy what Ringrose calls
"their hungry appetite of gold and riches."</p>

<p>Captain Coxen was chosen commander,
and the booty and prisoners sent back to the
ships under a guard of twelve men. The
Indians, being rewarded with presents of
needles and beads, also returned, all but the
king. Captain Andræas, Captain Antonio,
and the king's son, King Golden Cap (bonete
d'oro), as the Spaniards called him, resolved
to go on, desiring to see Panama sacked,
and offering to aid them with a large
body of men. The Spanish guide declared
he would not only lead them into the town,
but even to the very door of the governor of
Panama's bed-chamber, and that they should
take him by the hand, and seize him and
the whole city, before they should be discovered
by the Spaniards.</p>

<p>After remaining two days at Santa Maria,
they departed April 17th, 1680, for Panama.</p>

<p>They embarked in thirty-five canoes and a
piragua which they had found lying at
anchor, rowing down the river to the gulf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of Belona, where they would enter the South
Sea and work round to Panama. At the
request of the Indian king the fort, church,
and town were all burnt. The Spanish
prisoners, afraid of being put to death by the
savages if left behind, collected some bark
logs and leaky canoes, although the Buccaneers
could scarcely find boats for themselves,
and went with them.</p>

<p>Ringrose and four other men were put in
the heaviest and slowest canoe, and, getting
entangled between a shoal two miles long,
and obliged to wait for high water, the boat
being too heavy to row against tide, were soon
left behind. At night, it being again low
water, they stuck up an oar in the river, and,
in spite of a weltering rain, slept all night by
turns in the canoe. The next morning,
rowing two leagues, they overtook their
companions filling water at an Indian hut,
there being no more for six days' journey.
Hurrying to a pond a quarter of a mile distant
with their calabashes, they returned to
their boats and found the rest again gone and
out of sight. "Such," moralises Ringrose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
"is the procedure of these wild men, that they
care not in the least whom they lose of their
company or leave behind. We were now
more troubled in our minds than before,
fearing lest we should fall into the same
misfortune we had so lately overcome."</p>

<p>They rowed after them as fast as possible,
but in vain, and lost their way among the innumerable
islands of the river's mouth; but
at last, with much trouble and toil, hit the
Bocca Chica, the desired passage. But
though they saw the door, they could not
pass through, the "young flood" running violently
against them&mdash;although it was only a
stone's-cast off, and not a league broad.
Here, then, in despair they put ashore, fastening
the rope to a tree, almost covered by a
tide that flowed four fathoms deep.</p>

<p>As soon as the tide turned, they rowed to
an island about a league-and-a-half from the
river's mouth, in the gulf of St. Miguel,
in much danger from the waves, their boat
being twenty feet long, but not quite a foot-and-a-half
broad. Here they rested for the
night, wet through with the continual and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
impetuous rain, without water to drink, and
unable to light a fire, "for the loss of our
company, and the dangers we were in," says
Ringrose, "made it the sorrowfullest night
that, until then, I ever experimented." None
slept that tedious night, for a vast sea surrounded
them on one side, and the mighty
power of the Spaniards on the other. They
were all without shoes, and their clothes
were drenched through. They could see
nothing but sea, mountain, and rock.</p>

<p>At break of day they rowed past several
islands to the Point St. Laurence, one man
incessantly employed in baling. As they
passed one of these islands, a huge sea overturned
their boat, but they gained the beach,
swimming for life, and the canoe came
tumbling beside them. The arms fast lashed
at the bottom of the boat, the locks cased
and waxed down like the cartouche boxes,
and powder horns, escaped uninjured, but
the bread and fresh water were either spoiled
or lost. While carefully wiping and cleaning
their arms, for a Buccaneer's musket
was as his wife and child to him, they saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
another canoe tossed to shore, a little to leeward.
This proved to be six of the Spanish
prisoners, who had escaped in an old piragua
which was split to pieces, the English boat,
formed of wood, six inches thick, having
escaped unhurt. A common misfortune
makes all men friends, and the English and
Spaniards sat down together and broiled their
meat amicably at the same fire. They then
held a council, discussing for two or three
hours what course to take, and all the men but
Ringrose were for returning and living with
the Indians, if they could not reach the ships
lying in the northern sea. With much ado,
Ringrose prevailed on them to persist for
one day longer, and, just as they were concluding
their debate, the man on the look-out
cried that he saw Indians. Pursued into
the woods by two Buccaneers, they found
that he was one of the expedition, and had
arrived with seven others in a great canoe.
They were glad to see them, and declared,
to their joy, that, all in one canoe, they could
overtake the boats in the course of a day.
On seeing the Spaniards (Wankers they called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
them), they would have put them to death
but for Ringrose's interposition, for his men
stood by indifferent. They then insisted
on keeping one as a slave. Ringrose, still
fearing for their lives, gave the five Spaniards
his own canoe, and bade them shift for their
lives. Now in a large canoe, with a good
sail, and a fresh and strong gale, they made
brave way, with infinite joy and comfort of
heart, the smooth and easy passage, and the
pleasant, fresh ripple of the sea, filling them
with hope and gladness; but that very evening
it grew very dark, and rained heavily.
Suddenly two fires were seen to blaze up
from the opposite shore of the continent,
and the Indians, thinking they must indicate
the encampment of their people, shouted,
"Captain Antonio, Captain Andræas," and
made for the shore as fast as they could pull.
The canoe, however, had hardly got amongst
the breakers, before sixty Spaniards, armed
with clubs, leaped from the woods; and,
drawing the boat on land, made all the crew
their prisoners. Ringrose seized his gun,
and prepared for resistance, but was pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
down by four or five of the enemy. The
Indians, leaping overboard, escaped nimbly
into the woods. Ringrose spoke to his captors
in French and English, without obtaining
any answer. On addressing the strangers
in Latin, he discovered that they were the
Spanish prisoners from Santa Maria, who
had been liberated, for fear they might escape
when nearer Panama, and inform the city of
the Buccaneers' approach. The Englishmen
were presently taken with shouts of joy into
a hut made of boughs, and examined by the
Spanish captain, who meditated retaliating
upon them the injuries inflicted on the town.
At this critical juncture, the Spaniards whom
Ringrose had liberated came in, and explained
how they had been delivered from
the Indians. On hearing this, the Spanish
captain rose, and, embracing Ringrose, said,
"The English were good people, and very
friendly enemies, but the Indians very rogues,
and a treacherous nation." He then made
him sit down and eat with him, and consented,
for the kindness he had shown his
countrymen, to give him and all his men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
and even the Indians, if they could find them,
their lives and liberties, which otherwise
would have been forfeited. Finally, giving
them a canoe, the noble-hearted enemy bade
them go in God's name, praying that they
might be as fortunate as they had been generous.
All that night they skirted a dangerous
and iron coast, without daring to land.</p>

<p>The next morning, after sailing, paddling,
and rowing for a few hours, they saw a canoe
suddenly making towards them. It was one
of the English boats, which had mistaken
them for a Spanish piragua. They at once
conducted them to a deep bay, sheltered by
rocks, where the rest lay at anchor. They
were all delighted to see Ringrose and his
men, having given them up as lost. They
then made their way with all speed to a
hilly island, about seven leagues distant, and
surprised an old man, who was stationed
there to watch. The road up to the hut was
very steep, and the Buccaneers surrounded the
old man, who did not see them till they had
already entered his plantain walk. They
were much encouraged by his declaration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
that no tidings of their arrival had yet
reached Panama. About dusk, two of their
boats surprised a small bark that came and
anchored outside the island. The crew had
been absent eight days from the city, landing
soldiers on the adjacent shore, to curb
and drive back the Indians. The crews of
the smaller canoes now crowded into this
vessel to the number of 137 men, together
with Captain Cook and Captain Sharp, the
latter of whom Ringrose calls "a sea artist,
and valiant commander."</p>

<p>Next morning, rowing all day over shallow
water, they chased a bark, which Captain
Harris took after a sharp dispute, putting
on board a prize crew of thirty men. During
this pursuit the vessels scattered, and did
not reunite till next day at the island of
Chepillo, a preconcerted rendezvous. They
again chased a bark, but with less success,
and Captain Coxen's canoe missed the prize,
owing to a breeze springing up, having
one man killed and another wounded, and,
what was worst of all, the vessel not only
escaped, but spread the alarm at Panama.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
At Chepillo they took fourteen negro and
mulatto prisoners, and secured two fat hogs,
plenty of plantains, and some good water.
Believing it useless now to attack Panama,
the Buccaneers resolved to hurry on to the
town to at least surprise some of the shipping.
Their boats had the addition of
another piragua, which they found lying at
Chepillo. Before starting, the captains
cruelly decided, for reasons which Ringrose
could not fathom, to allow the Indians to
murder all the Spanish prisoners before their
eyes, the savages having long thirsted for
their blood. But by a singular coincidence
the prisoners, though without arms, forced
their way by a sudden rush through all the
Indian spears and arrows, and escaped unhurt
into the woods, to the chagrin of both
white and black savages.</p>

<p>Staying only a few hours at Chepillo, the
boats started at four o'clock in the evening,
intending to reach Panama, which was only
seven leagues distant, before the next morning.
The next day (St. George's day),
before sunrise they arrived at Panama, "a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
city," says Ringrose, "which has a very
pleasant prospect seaward." They could see
all the ships of the city lying at anchor at
the island of Perico, two leagues distant,
where storehouses had been built. There
now rode at anchor five great ships and three
smaller armadillas, (little men-of-war). This
fleet, which had been hastily manned to defend
the city, as soon as they saw the Buccaneers,
weighed anchor, got under sail, and
bore down at once upon them, directly before
the wind, and with such velocity as to
threaten to run them down. The Spanish
admiral's vessel was manned by ninety Biscayans,
agile seamen and stout soldiers.
They were all volunteers, and had come out
to show their valour under the command of
Don Jacinto de Barahona, high-admiral of
those seas. In the second were seventy-seven
negroes, led by a brave old Andalusian,
Don Francisco de Peralta. In the third,
making 228 men in all, were sixty-five mulattoes,
under Don Diego de Carabaxal. The
Spaniards had strict orders given them to
grant no quarter.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span></p>

<p>To add to the disparity of numbers, only
a few of the Buccaneers' boats were able to
arrive in time. The first five canoes that
came up, leaving the heavy piraguas still
lagging behind, contained only thirty-seven
men, and these were tired with rowing in the
wind's eye, and trying to get close to the
windward of the enemy. The lesser piragua
coming up with thirty-two more men,
made a total force of sixty Buccaneers, including
the king of Darien, engaged in this
daring resistance to an overwhelming force.</p>

<p>Carabaxal's vessel, passing between Sawkins's
and Ringrose's canoes, fired at both,
wounding four men in the former and one in
the latter, but being slow in tacking, the
Spaniard paid dear for his passage, the first return
volley killing several men upon his decks.
Almost before they had time to reload, the
admiral passed, but the Buccaneers' second
volley quite disabled their giant antagonist,
killing the man at the helm; and the ship ran
into the wind and her sails lay aback. She
fell now like a lamed elephant at the mercy
of the hunters; the canoes, pulling under her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
stern, fired continually upon the deck, killing
all who dared to touch the helm, and cutting
asunder the mainsheet and mainbrace. Sawkins,
whose canoe was disabled, went next
into the piragua to meet Peralta, leaving the
four canoes to harass the admiral. Between
Sawkins and Peralta, lying alongside of each
other, the fight was desperate, each crew
trying to board, and firing as quick as they
could load. In the mean time the first vessel
tacked about and came to relieve the admiral,
but the canoes, seeing the danger of being
beaten from the admiral's stern and allowing
him to rally, sent two of their number
(Springer and Ringrose) to meet Peralta.
The admiral stood upon his quarter-deck,
waving his handkerchief as a signal for his
captains to come at once to his help. The
canoes pursued Peralta, and would have
boarded him had he not given them the helm
and made away.</p>

<p>Giving a loud shout, the remaining boats
wedged up the admiral's rudder and poured
in a blinding volley, that killed the admiral
and chief pilot. Two-thirds of the Spaniards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
being now killed, many wounded, and all
disheartened at the bloody massacre of the
Buccaneers' shot, cried for quarter, which
they had been already several times offered,
and at once surrendered. Captain Coxen
then boarded the prize, taking with him
Captain Harris, who had been shot through
both legs as he was heading a boarding party.
They put all their other wounded men on
board, and, manning two canoes, hurried off
to aid Sawkins, who had already been three
times beaten off by Peralta.</p>

<p>Coming close under his side and giving
him a full volley, they were expecting a return,
when suddenly a volcano of fire spouted
up from the deck, and all the Spaniards abaft
the mast were blown into the air or sea.
While the brave captain, leaping overboard,
was helping the drowning men in spite of
the rain of shot and the pain of his own
burns, another jar of powder blew up in the
forecastle. Under cover of the smoke and
confusion, Sawkins boarded and took the
ship, or at least all that was left of it.
Ringrose says it was a miserable sight, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
a man but was either killed or desperately
wounded, blind, or horribly burnt with the
powder. In some cases the white wounds
where the flesh had peeled to the bone,
showed through the blackening of the powder.
The admiral had but twenty-five men
left out of eighty-six, and of these twenty-five
only eight were now able to bear
arms.</p>

<p>The blood ran down the deck in streams,
and every rope and plank was smeared with
gore.</p>

<p>Peralta, as prudent as he was brave, attempted
by every possible argument, forgetful
of his own wounds and the death of his
men, to induce the Buccaneers not to attack
the remaining vessels in the harbour. In
the biggest alone he said there were 350
men, and the rest were well defended. But
a dying sailor, lifting up his head from the
deck, contradicted him, and said that they
had not a man on board, all their crews being
placed in the armadillas. Trusting to dying
treason rather than living fidelity, the Buccaneers
instantly proceeded to the island,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
and found the ships deserted. The largest, <i>La
Santissima Trinidada</i>, had been set on fire, the
crew, loosing her foresail, having pierced her
bottom. The captains soon quenched the fire,
and stopping the leak turned their prize into
a floating hospital-ship. They found they
had eighteen men killed and twenty-two
wounded (only two of whom died) in this
desperate sea battle, which began an hour after
sunrise and ended at noon. The third vessel,
it appeared, while running away had met
with two others, but even with this reinforcement
refused to fight.</p>

<p>Their brave prisoner, Peralta, now that all
was over, broke out into repeated praises of
their courage, which was so congenial to his
own. He said: "You Englishmen are the
valiantest men in the whole world, always
desiring to fight open, while all other nations
invent all the ways imaginable to barricade
themselves, and fight as close as possible."
"Notwithstanding all this," adds Ringrose,
"we killed more of our enemies than they
of us." Two days after the battle the Buccaneers
buried Captain Harris, a brave Englishman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
of the county of Kent, whose death
was much lamented by the fleet.</p>

<p>The new city of Panama, built four miles
more easterly than that which Morgan burnt,
had been three times destroyed by fire since
that event. A few people still lived round
the cathedral in the old town. The new city
was bigger than the old one, and built chiefly
of brick and stone, and was defended by a
garrison of 300 soldiers and 1,000 militiamen.
They afterwards learnt that the troops
were then absent, and that if they had
landed instead of attacking the fleet, they
might have taken the place, all the best
shots being on board the admiral's vessel.</p>

<p>In the five vessels taken at Perico there
was much spoil. The <i>Trinidada</i> (400 tons)
was laden with wine, sugar, sweetmeats,
skins, and soap. The second, of 300 tons,
partly laden with bars of iron, one of the
richest commodities brought into the South
Sea, was burnt by the Buccaneers, because
the Spaniards would not redeem it. The
third, of 180 tons, laden with sugar, was
given to Captain Cook; the fourth, an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
vessel (60 tons), laden with meal, was burnt
as useless, with all her cargo. The fifth, of
50 tons, with a piragua, fell to the lot of
Captain Coxen. The two armadillas, the
rigging and sails being saved, and a bark
laden with poultry, were also burnt.</p>

<p>Captain Coxen, indignant at charges made
against him of cowardice in the late action, determined
to rejoin the ships in the northern
seas, together with seventy men who had
assisted in his election. The Indian king,
Don Andræas, and Don Antonio, returned
with him. The king left his son and nephew
in the care of Captain Sawkins, who was now
commander-in-chief, and desired him not to
spare the Spaniards. A few days after Captain
Sharp returned from the King's islands,
having taken a Spanish vessel and burnt his
own. Captain Harris's crew had also taken a
vessel, and, dismasting their own, turned
their prisoners adrift in the hulk, and soon
after taking a poultry vessel, the meanest of
the Spaniards were treated in the same way.</p>

<p>Having remained now ten days at Panama,
the fleet steered to the island of Tavoga,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
where they found a village of 100 houses
quite deserted, and many of these were burnt
by the carelessness of a drunken sailor. The
Panama merchants came here to sell the Buccaneers
commodities and to purchase the
plunder from their own vessels, giving 200
pieces of eight for every negro. Staying
eight days, they captured a vessel from
Truxillo laden with money to pay the garrison
of Panama, while in the hold were 2,000
jars of wine and fifty jars of gunpowder. A
flour vessel from the same place informed
them that a ship was coming in a few days
laden with 100,000 more pieces of eight.</p>

<p>To a message from the President, who
sent by some merchants to ask why they
came into those parts, Captain Sawkins replied,
that he came to assist the King of
Darien, the true lord of the country, and he
required a ransom of 500 pieces of eight for
each sailor, and 1,000 for the commander.
He must also promise not to molest the Indians,
who were the natural owners of the
soil. Hearing from the messengers that a
certain priest, now bishop of Panama, formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
of Santa Martha, lay in the city, Sawkins,
remembering that he had been his prisoner
when he took that city five years before,
sent him two loaves of sugar as a present.
The next day the bishop replied by forwarding
him a gold ring. The President, at the
same time, sent another letter, desiring to
see his commission, that he might know to
what power to complain. Sawkins replied,
that as yet all his men were not come together,
but when they had met, they would
come up to Panama, and bring their commissions
on the muzzles of their guns, at
which time he should read them as plain as
the flame of gunpowder would let him.</p>

<p>The men growing now mutinous for fresh
meat, Sawkins was compelled to give up his
hopes of capturing the rich vessel from Peru,
and to sail to the island of Otoque, to buy
fowls and hogs, losing two barks, one with
seven, and the other with fifteen men. While
lying off the pearl fishery of Cayboa, Sawkins
and Sharp made an unfortunate attack
with sixty men on the town of Puebla Nueva.
They were piloted up the river in canoes by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
a negro prisoner. A mile below the town,
great trees had been laid to block up the
stream, and before the town three strong
breastworks were thrown up. Sawkins,
running furiously up the sloping ramparts,
was shot dead, and his men driven back to
their boats, two men being killed, and three
wounded, in the retreat, which was made in
pretty good order. They soon after, however,
captured a vessel laden with indigo,
and burnt two others. This Captain Sawkins,
Ringrose says, was as valiant and courageous
as any, and, next to Captain Sharp,
the best beloved. His death was much lamented,
and occasioned another overland expedition.
Sharp, surrendering his last prize to
Captain Cook, took his vessel and gave it to
the sixty-three men who wished to return
home. They led with them all the Indians
to serve as guides overland.</p>

<p>Before they started, Sharp, in full council
on board the <i>Trinidada</i>, offered to insure to all
who would carry out Sawkins's scheme, and
go home by the Straits of Magellan, a £1000
profit, but none would stay. Ringrose himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
acknowledges he should have left with
them, but was afraid of the Indians, and the
long and dangerous journey in the rainy
season.</p>

<p>At Cayboa, the men took in water and
cut wood, killing alligators, and salting deer
and turtle. Here two "remarkable events"
happened to Ringrose. In the first place,
he ate an oyster so large that he found it
necessary to cut it into four large mouthfuls:
secondly, as he was washing himself in a
pond, some drops fell on him from a mançanilla
tree, and these drops broke out into a
red eruption that lasted a week. Here
Sharp burnt one of his prizes for the sake
of the iron work, and received Captain Cook,
whose men had revolted, on board his own
ship, making John Cox, a New Englander,
commander in his stead.</p>

<p>Sharp now determined to careen at the island
of Gorgona, and then to proceed to Guayaquil,
where Captain Juan, the captain of the
Tavoga money ship, assured them they might
throw away their silver and lade with gold.
They selected Gorgona, because, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
of the perpetual rain, the Spaniards seldom
touched there. The sailors, who had lost
their money at gambling, were impatient of
these delays, and declared that the Spaniards
would now gain time, and the whole coast
be alarmed, and on the defensive. But the
richer men, wanting rest, decided for Gorgona.</p>

<p>In this island, they fished their mainmast,
shot at whales, killed monkeys, snakes,
and turtle for food, being short of provision,
caught a large sloth, and killed a serpent,
fourteen inches thick, and twelve feet long.
While moored here, Joseph Gabriel, the
Chilian, who stole the Indian king's daughter,
died of a malignant calenture. He had
been very faithful, and discovered many
plots and conspiracies among the prisoners of
intended escapes and murders.</p>

<p>Sharp now abandoned the design on Guayaquil,
and resolved to attack Arica, the dépôt
of all the Potosi plate. An old man who had
served much with the Spaniards, promised
them £2000 a-man.</p>

<p>After a fortnight's sail they arrived at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
island of Plate, so called from Drake dividing
his plunder there among his men. The
Spaniards had a tradition, that he took
twelve score tons of plate in the galleon
armada, and that each of his forty-five men
had sixteen bowls full of coined money&mdash;his
ships being so full that they were obliged to
throw much of it overboard. In the adjoining
bay of Manta, in Cromwell's time, a
Lima vessel, laden with thirty millions of
dollars, on its way as a present to Charles I.,
was lost by keeping too near the shore.
While catching goats on this island, on which
the cross of the first Spanish discoverer still
stood, they were joined by Captain Cox,
whom they had lost a fortnight before, as
they feared, irrecoverably. They killed and
salted on this island 100 goats in a day,
and one man alone, in a few hours, in one
small bay turned seventeen turtle. Peralta
congratulated them on getting as far to windward
in two weeks as the Spanish captains
did in three months, from their keeping boldly
so far from the shore.</p>

<p>While passing Guayaquil, they espied a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Spanish vessel and gave chase. Being hailed
in Spanish by an Indian prisoner, to lower
their topsails, the enemy replied they would
pull down the Englishman's first, and answered
with their arquebuses to the Buccaneers'
muskets, till, one bullet killing the man at
the helm and another cutting their maintop
halliards, they cried out for quarter. There
were thirty-five men on board, including
twenty-four Spaniards and several persons of
quality. The captain's brother, since the
death of Don Jacinto de Barahona at Panama,
was admiral of the armada. The Buccaneers'
rigging was much cut during the fight, and
two men were wounded, besides a sailor who
was shot by an accident. The captain, it
appears, had in a bravado sworn to attack
their fleet if he could meet it. The Spaniard,
a very "civil and meek gentleman," informed
them that the governor of Lima, hearing of
their visit to Panama, had collected five ships
and 750 sailors; while two other vessels and
400 soldiers, furnished by the viceroy, were
preparing to start. A patache with twenty-four
guns was also lying at Callao, ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
remove the king's plate from Arica. At
Guayaquil they had built two forts, and
mustered 850 men of all colours. The same
day the English unrigged their new prize
and sank her.</p>

<p>Reckoning up the pillage, they found they
had now 3,276 pieces of eight, which were at
once divided. The same day they punished
a Spanish friar, who was chaplain in the last
prize, and, shooting him on the deck, flung
him overboard before he was dead. "Such
cruelties," says Ringrose, "though I abhorred
very much in my heart, yet here I was
forced to hold my tongue and not contradict
them, as having no authority to oversway
them." The prisoners now confessed they
had killed a boat full of the Buccaneers' men,
lost near Cayboa, and had discovered from
the only survivor the plan on Guayaquil.</p>

<p>Captain Cox's vessel being so slow as to
require towing, they sank it, so there were now
140 men and boys and fifty-five prisoners in
one and the same bottom. While to the
leeward of Tumbes, Peralta told them a
legend of a priest having once landed there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
in the face of 10,000 Indians, who stared at
his uplifted cross. As he stepped out of his
boat on the shore, before the water could
efface his footprints, two lions and two tigers
came out of the woods to meet him, but when
he gently laid the cross on their backs, they
fell down and worshipped it, upon which all
the Indians came forward and were baptised.</p>

<p>The night they passed Paita they espied a
sail and gave chase, following it by the lights
which it showed through negligence. Scantiness
of provisions made them more eager
in the pursuit, and coming up the Spaniard instantly
lowered all her sails and surrendered.
The Buccaneers casting dice as to who should
first board, the lot fell to the larboard watch.
The vessel contained fifty packs of cocoa, and a
great deal of raw silk and India cloth, besides
many bales of thread stockings. The prize
being plundered and dismasted, the prisoners
were turned adrift in it, supplied with only
a foresail, some water, and a little flour.
The chief prisoners, as Don Thomas de
Argandona, commander of the Guayaquil
vessel, and his friends Don Christoval and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Don Baltazar, gentlemen of quality, Captain
Peralta, Moreno, a pilot, and twelve slaves,
to do the drudgery, were still kept. The
next day the sailor wounded in taking the
Guayaquil vessel, died, and was buried with
ceremony, three French volleys being fired
as the body was let down into the deep.</p>

<p>Their next expedition was to attack Arica
with 112 men, first sending five boats to
capture some fishermen at the river of Juan
Diaz, whom they might employ as spies.</p>

<p>To their great chagrin they found the
landing impracticable, and the whole coast
in arms. Troops of horse covered the low
hills round the bay, and close beneath six ships
rode at anchor. Abandoning this project,
these indefatigable marauders (more pirates
than real Buccaneers) despatched four
canoes and fifty men, to plunder the town
of Hillo. On the shore the English were
met by some horsemen, who fled after a few
volleys. Marching to the town, they forced
their way through a small breastwork of clay
and sandbags, and took the town. Keeping
good watch for fear of surprise, a dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Indian, wounded in the skirmish, told them
that the townspeople had heard from Lima
nine days before, and expected their coming.
In the town they found pitch, wine, oil, and
flour, and sixty of the ablest men were sent up
the adjoining valley to reconnoitre. They
found it beautifully planted with fig, lemon,
lime, olive, and orange trees, and four miles
up came to a sugar-mill, the greater part of
the sugar having been removed. The Spaniards,
watching them from the hills, rolled
stones upon them, but hid themselves when
a musket-shot was fired in retaliation. Captain
Cox and a Dutch interpreter being
despatched with a flag of truce to the Spaniards,
they agreed to give eighty beeves
as a ransom for the mill, and a message was
despatched to Captain Sharp not to injure
the drivers of the oxen when they came.
Hearing that sixteen beeves had already arrived
at the port, the men, contrary to Ringrose's
opinion, returned to the ships laden
with sugar, and found the whole story of the
oxen's arrival a mere <i>ruse de guerre</i>. The
Spaniards being appealed to promised the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
cattle should arrive that night, but at last
declared the wind was so high they could
not drive the herds. Enraged at this delay,
the Buccaneers, who had now taken in
water, marched 100 men up the valley, and
burned the house, the mill, and the canes,
carried off the sugar, broke the oil jars, and
cracked the copper wheels. Near the shore
they were charged by a body of 300 horsemen,
who took them by surprise, but not
before they had thrown down the sugar and
taken up their arms.</p>

<p>Ringrose shall tell the rest: "We being in
good rank and order," he says, "fairly proffered
them battle upon the bay; but as we advanced
to meet them, they retired and rid
towards the mountains, to surround us, and
take the rocks from us, if possibly they could.
Hereupon, perceiving their intentions, we returned
back and possessed ourselves of the
said rocks, and also of the lower town, as
the Spaniards themselves did of the upper
town (at the distance of half-a-mile from the
lower), the hills and the woods adjoining
thereunto. The horsemen being now in possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of those quarters, we could perceive
as far as we could see, more and more men
resort unto them, so that their forces increased
hourly to considerable numbers. We
fired at one another as long as we could see,
and the day would permit. But in the mean
time we observed that several of them rid
to the watch hill and looked out often to the
seaward. This gave us occasion to fear that
they had more strength and forces coming
that way, which they expected every minute.
Hereupon, lest we should speed worse than
we had done before, we resolved to embark
silently in the dark of the night." They carried
off a great chest of sugar (seven pounds
and a-half to each man), thirty jars of oil,
and much fruit, wild and cultivated. From
appearances next morning they believed the
enemy had also fled in the night, as only fifty
men could be seen. The prisoners, seeing
a comet at dusk, told the Englishmen that
many such appearances had preceded the
arrival of the Buccaneers in the South Sea.
Their brave prisoner, Captain Peralta, began
at this time to show signs of insanity, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
mind being shaken by continued hardship
and despair at his long imprisonment.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers next landed 100 men,
hoping to take by surprise the city of La
Serena. Here, too, they found the Spaniards
vigilant, and had to break through 100 horsemen
to reach the town, killing three officers
and wounding four men. The town contained
seven great churches and many rich
merchants' houses surrounded by gardens.
The inhabitants had fled, and either carried
away or buried all their treasures, and a Chilian
prisoner said the Spaniards had killed most
of their negro and even their Chilian slaves,
for fear of their revolting and joining the
Buccaneers. A party of forty men, with a
Chilian guide, searched the woods in vain to
secure prisoners for guides. The Spaniards,
sending a flag of truce, agreed to pay 95,000
pieces of eight as ransom for the town; but,
not bringing it in, the place was set on fire.
Taking advantage of an earthquake, the
Spaniards opened the sluices and inundated
the streets. Every house, Ringrose says, was
separately fired to render the conflagration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
complete. Two parties were then despatched
laden with booty to the ships, who on their
way beat up an ambuscade of 250 Spanish
horse. During their absence, a daring attempt
was made to burn their ship. The
enemy hired a man who floated under the
stern of the ship on a horse's hide, blown out
like a bladder. He then stuffed oakum
and brimstone between the keel and the
stern-post, and set the rudder on fire. The
men, alarmed at the smoke, ran up and down,
not knowing where the fire could be, and
believing the prisoners had done it in order
to escape. The source of the evil was at last
discovered, and the flames extinguished. The
Buccaneers, before sailing, released all their
prisoners, not knowing what to do with them,
and fearing that they would revolt or perhaps
try to burn the ship.</p>

<p>On reaching the island of Juan Fernandez,
they solemnized the festival of Christmas by
discharging three volleys of shot, and killing
sixty goats in one day. The shore was
covered so thick with seals that they were
obliged to shoot a few in order to land. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
then filled 200 water-jars, and were nearly
lost in a place called "False Wild Harbour,"
where they killed several sea-lions. Their
beds they made of fern. It was on this
island, their pilot told them, a deserted sailor
(Alexander Selkirk) had lived five years.</p>

<p>The men now in the midst of storms
and dangers, were all in a mutiny. Some
were for going back to England or the plantations,
and returning by the straits of Magellan;
others for continuing longer in those
seas. All agreed to depose Captain Sharp
and elect John Watling, an old privateer,
"and a stout seaman." The next Sunday
was the first, says Ringrose, that had been
kept by common consent since the death of
Sawkins, who would throw the dice overboard
if he found any in use on that day.</p>

<p>Juan Fernandez abounded in cabbage palms
and building timber. The fish swarmed in
such quantities that they could be caught
with the bare hook, one sailor in a few hours
capturing enough for the whole crew. Shoals
a mile long were seen in the bay. While
busily employed in catching fish, shooting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
goats, and cutting timber, the hunters suddenly
gave the alarm of three Spanish men-of-war
approaching the island, and, slipping
their cables, the Buccaneers put out hurriedly
to sea. In the confusion, William, a Mosquito
Indian, who could not be found at the
time, was left behind to endure the hardships
that a few days before he may have heard
the pilot relate as experienced by the celebrated
Alexander Selkirk (the prototype of
Robinson Crusoe).</p>

<p>The three Spanish vessels proved to be the
<i>El Santo Christo</i>, of 800 tons, carrying twelve
guns; the <i>San Francisco</i>, of 600 tons, with
ten guns; and a third of 350 tons. As soon
as they came in sight, they hung out "bloody
flags;" and the Buccaneers, nothing daunted,
did the same. The English, keeping close
under the wind, were very unwilling to fight,
as the Spaniards held together, and their
new commander, Watling, showed a faint
heart. The trio eventually sheered off, glad
to escape uninjured.</p>

<p>Determining to pay a second visit to Arica,
twenty-five men and two canoes were despatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
to obtain guides from the island of
Yqueque. On the shore of the mainland
they found a hut built of whales' bones, a
cross, and some broken jars.</p>

<p>They brought away from the island, which
they could not at first discover, two old
white men and two Indians. The people of
Arica, they found, came to this place to
buy clay, and the natives were obliged to
fetch all the water they used from the mainland.
The Indians wore no clothes, and
chewed leaves which dyed their teeth green.
One of the old prisoners being examined was
shot to death by order of the commander,
who believed him to be lying, although, as
it afterwards appeared, he told nothing but
the truth. Sharp was troubled and dissatisfied
at this cruel and rash order, and,
taking water and washing his hands, he
said, "Gentlemen, I am clear of the blood
of this old man, and will warrant you a hot
day for this piece of cruelty whenever we
come to fight at Arica." The other prisoner
said that he was the superintendent of fifty
slaves belonging to the governor of the town.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
These slaves caught fish and sold them when
dried in the inland towns. There were then
three Chilian ships and a bark in the harbour,
and a fortification of twelve guns in
the town. The people had already, he said,
heard from Coquimbo of their arrival, and
removed and buried their treasure. There
were also, they heard, breast-works round
the town, and barricades in every street.</p>

<p>Disregarding these warnings, the Buccaneers
embarked next day in a launch and
four canoes, rowing and sailing all night, in
hopes of surprising Arica. At daybreak
they hid themselves under the cliffs for fear
of being seen, and at night began again to
row. On Sunday (Jan. 30), 1680&mdash;"sacred
to the memory of King Charles the Martyr"&mdash;they
landed among some rocks four miles
to the south of the town, ninety-two men
going on shore, the rest staying to defend
the boats. The signal agreed on was, that at
one smoke, they should come up to the harbour
in one canoe; but if there were two
smokes, they should "bring all away, leaving
only fifteen men with the boats." Mounting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
a steep hill, they could see no Spaniards,
and hoped that the surprise was complete;
but as they were descending the other side,
three horsemen on the look-out hill rode
down at full speed and alarmed the city. The
forty men who attacked the fort with hand
grenades, seeing their companions overpowered,
ran down into the valley to join them.
"Here the battle was very desperate, and
they killed and wounded two more of our
men from their outworks before we could
gain upon them. But our rage increasing
with our wounds, we still advanced, and at
last beat the enemy out of all, and filled
every street in the city with dead bodies.
The enemy made several retreats from one
breast-work to another, but, we had not a
sufficient number of men to man all places
taken. Insomuch, that we had no sooner
beat them out of one place but they came
another way, and manned it again with new
forces and fresh men." So says Ringrose.</p>

<p>Imprudently overburdening themselves
with prisoners, they found there were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
the place 400 soldiers from Lima, 200 armed
townsmen, and 300 men garrisoning the
fort. Being now nearly masters of the place,
the English sent to demand the surrender of
the fort, and, receiving no answer, advanced
to the attack. Several times repulsed, the
Buccaneers at last mounted the top of a
neighbouring house and fired down into the
castle; but, being again surrounded by the
enemy, they were obliged to desist. The
number and vigour of the enemy increased
hourly, and, almost overpowered, the English
were compelled to retreat to the hospital where
the surgeons were tending the wounded.
Captain Watling and both quartermasters
were killed, and many were disabled. We
will let Ringrose tell the rest:&mdash;</p>

<p>"So that now, the enemy rallying against
us, and beating us from place to place, we
were in a very distracted condition, and in
more likelihood to perish, every man, than
escape the bloodshed of that day. Now we
found the words of Captain Sharp true,
being all very sensible that we had a day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
too hot for us, after that cruel heat in killing
and murdering in cold blood the old Mestizo
Indian.</p>

<p>"Being surrounded with difficulties on all
sides, and in great disorder, having nobody
to give orders, what was to be done? We
were glad to have our eyes upon our good
old commander, Captain Bartholomew Sharp,
and beg of him very earnestly to commiserate
our condition, and carry us off. It was
a great while before he would take any notice
of our request, so much was he displeased
with the former mutiny of our people
against him, all which had been occasioned
by the instigation of Mr. Cook.</p>

<p>"But Mr. Sharp is a man of an undaunted
courage, and excellent conduct, not fearing
in the least to look an insulting enemy in
the face, and a person that knows both the
theory and practice of navigation as well as
most do. Hereupon, at our earnest request
and petition, he took upon him the command
in chief again, and began to distribute his
orders for our safety. He would have brought
off our surgeons, but they, having been drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
while we assaulted the fort, would not come
with us when they were called. They killed
and took of our number twenty-eight men, besides
eighteen that we brought off, who were
desperately wounded. At that time we were
all extremely faint for want of water and victuals,
whereof we had none all that day. We
were likewise almost choked with the dust of
the town, being so much raised by the work
that their guns had made, that we could
scarce see each other. They beat us out of
the town, then followed us into the savannahs,
still charging as fast as they could.
But when they saw that we rallied, again
resolving to die one by another, they ran
from us into the town, and sheltered themselves
under their breast-works. Thus we
retreated in as good order as we possibly
could observe in that confusion. But their
horsemen followed us as we retired, and fired
at us all the way, though they would not
come within reach of our guns, for theirs
reached further than ours, and outshot us
above one-third. We took the sea-side for
our greater security, which when the enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
saw, they betook themselves to the hills,
rolling down great stones and whole rocks
to destroy us. Meanwhile, those of the
town examined our surgeons, and other men
whom they had made prisoners. These gave
them our signs that we had left to our boats
that were behind us, so that they immediately
blew up two fires, which were perceived
by the canoes. This was the greatest
of our dangers; for had we not come at that
instant that we did to the sea-side, our boats
had been gone, they being already under
sail, and we had inevitably perished every
man. Thus we put off from the shore, and
got on board about ten at night, having been
involved in a bloody fight with the enemy
all the day."</p>

<p>The Buccaneers, thus cruelly baffled, plied
for some time outside the port, hoping to be
revenged on the three ships, but they did
not venture out. Arica Ringrose describes as
a square place, with the castle at one corner.
The houses were only eleven feet high, and
built of earth. It was the place of embarkation
for all minerals sent to Lima. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
the English prisoners, only ten survived.
The Spaniards lost more than seventy men,
three times as many being wounded, and of
forty-five allies from Hillo only two returned
alive.</p>

<p>On dividing the plate, they found only
thirty-seven pieces of eight fell to each man.
Landing at Guasco, they took in 500 jars of
water, and carried off 120 sheep, 80 goats,
and 200 bushels of flour. At Hillo they
surprised the townsmen asleep, and heard a
false report that 5000 Englishmen had taken
Panama. They carried off eighteen jars of
wine and some new figs, and, ascending to the
sugar-work they had before visited, laded
seven mules with molasses and sugar. The
townsmen told them, that the owner of the
mill had brought an action against them for
having done him more injury than the Buccaneers.</p>

<p>A few days after this another mutiny
broke out, and forty-seven men, refusing to
serve any longer under Captain Sharp, landed
near the island of Plate, with five Indian
slaves to serve as guides. Near the island<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
of Chica they captured two Spanish vessels,
one of them the very ship they had captured
before at Panama. They heard here that
some of their overland parties had taken a
good ship at Porto Bello. Capturing some
Spanish shipwrights at this place, they employed
them for a fortnight in altering
their vessel, and then set them at liberty,
with some others of their prisoners, giving
them one of their prizes, and manning the
other with six men and two slaves.</p>

<p>They now agreed in council to bear up for
Golfo Dolce, there to careen their vessels, and
then to cruise about under the equinoctial.
They landed in Golfo Dolce, and, treating
kindly some Indians whom they took prisoners,
bought honey and plantains of them. Here
they learned that the Spaniards, having
treacherously captured forty Darien chiefs,
had forced the natives into a peace. Having
careened here, they soon after captured a rich
prize, the <i>San Pedro</i>, bound from Truxillo
to Panama, deeply laden with 37,000 pieces
of eight, in chest and bags, besides plate.
This was the same vessel they had taken the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
year before, and it was now their prize a
second time in fourteen months. The crew
consisted of forty men, besides friars and
merchants. Taking out part of her lading
of cocoa, they cut down her masts and turned
her adrift with all the old slaves, as "<i>a reward
for good service</i>," taking new ones from the
prize. Francisco, a negro, who had attempted
to escape by swimming on shore in the Golfo
Dolce, they retained as a prisoner, as a punishment
for his insubordination. From this prize
each Buccaneer received 234 pieces of eight,
much being left for a future division. They
learnt from this vessel that a new Viceroy of
Peru, arrived at Panama, had not dared to
venture to Lima in his ship of twenty-five
guns, but had waited for the armada as a
convoy. A few days later, they captured
the packet that ran between Lima and Panama.
A friar and five negroes escaped on
shore, but two white women were captured.
Rummaging the boat, they found nothing of
value but a letter announcing the departure
of the viceroy with four ships. The prisoners
and the boat were then released. "That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
week," says Ringrose, "we stood out to
sea all night long, most of our men being
fuddled."</p>

<p>The next day they captured a Spanish
vessel that had at first frightened them by
its size. The volleys of the Buccaneers
soon drove the Spaniards into the hold and
made them cry for quarter, having killed the
captain at the first fire, and wounded the
boatswain. Captain Sharp and twelve
others were the first to board. She proved
to be <i>El Santo Rosario</i>, commanded by Don
Diego Lopez, bound from Callao to Panama.
The crew were forty in number. She was
deeply laden with plate and coined money,
and carried 620 jars of wine and brandy. At
Cape Passao Sharp sank the bark taken at
Nicoya, preserving her rigging, and disabling
the last prize set the prisoners adrift in it,
keeping only the one man, named Francisco,
who had described himself as the best pilot
in those seas. They then divided the booty,
which came to ninety-four pieces of eight
a man. From these prisoners they learned
that their men taken at Arica had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
kindly treated at Callao. Of the last party
that one had been captured, and the rest
had had to fight their way overland through
Indians and Spaniards. Ten Buccaneers
were also announced as about to enter the
South Sea. In August they landed again to
kill goats on the island of Plate, where Ringrose
and James Chappel, a quartermaster,
fought a duel on shore, with what result
we do not know. The same evening a conspiracy
of the slaves was detected, in which
they had plotted to slay all their masters
when in drink, not sparing any. The ringleader,
San Jago, a prisoner from Yqueque,
leaped overboard when the plot was discovered,
and was shot by the captain. The
rest, being terrified at his death, were forgiven,
and the same night the usual debauch
took place in spite of the danger. From
their pilot they heard that a Lima vessel
bound for Guayaquil had run ashore lately
on Santa Clara, losing 100,000 pieces of
eight, that would have been their prize.
They heard also that the Viceroy of Peru
had beheaded the great Admiral Ponce for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
not destroying the Buccaneer fleet while at
Gorgona.</p>

<p>They next made a descent on Paita, but
found the place garrisoned by three companies
horse and foot, well armed, from
Puira, twelve leagues up the country. 150
musketeers and 400 lancers occupied a hill
and a breast-work, and fired upon the canoes.
Had they suffered them to land they might
have killed them to a man. Finding the
whole coast now alarmed, they bore at once
away for the Straits of Magellan. Touching
at some unknown islands, they were almost
inclined to winter there. Here they shot
geese, made broth of limpets, and one of
the boats captured an Indian and shot
another dead. The prisoner was clad in a
seal's skin, and carried a net to catch penguins.
He was so strong as to be able to
open mussels with his fingers, and they kept
him as a slave, and called him Orson. They
then proceeded to divide eight chests of
money still unallotted, and each man received
322 pieces of eight. On December 7th Captain
Sharp received intelligence of a conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
to shoot him during the ensuing
festivities of Christmas-day. The only precaution
he took was at once to divide all the
wine in store, believing that no sober man
would attempt so dastardly an act. Each
mess received three jars. The cold grew
now so intense that several of the negro
slaves had their feet mortify, and some died.
Christmas-day was celebrated by killing a fat
sow, this being the first flesh the men had
eaten since they left the island of Plata. By
January 16th the days grew very hot again,
and the nights cool and dewy. The men, weary
of the voyage, offered a piece of eight "each
man" to him who first discovered land. The
sight of birds soon indicated this, and January
28th the look-out spied Barbadoes; but
hearing of peace they dared not put in for
fear of being seized, and therefore steered for
Antigua, much afraid of frigates, and shunning
even a Bristol interloper that lay in the
offing. Ringrose says: "Here I cannot
easily express the infinite joy we were possessed
with all this day, to see our own
countrymen again." They then freed a negro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
shoemaker, whom they had kept as a prisoner,
and who had been very serviceable
during the voyage. To Captain Sharp the men
gave a mulatto boy as slave, for a token of
the respect of his whole company to him for
having led them safely through so many
dangerous adventures. They then divided
the last parcels of money, and received
twenty-four pieces of eight a man. A little
Spanish shock dog, taken from a prize, was
also sold at the mast by public outcry, for
forty pieces of eight, the owner promising all
he gained should be devoted to a general feast.
Captain Sharp bought the dog, saying he
would eat it if they did not soon get leave to
land. 100 pieces of eight was also added
to the store, the boatswain, carpenter, and
quartermaster having quarrelled about the
last dividend.</p>

<p>On reaching Antigua Sharp sent a canoe
ashore to buy tobacco and other necessaries,
and to ask leave of the governor to land.
The conclusion of Ringrose's book tells the
rest: "The gentry of the place and common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
people were very willing and desirous to receive
us, but on Wednesday, February 1st,
the governor flatly refused us entry, at
which all the gentry were much troubled,
showing themselves very kind to us; hereupon
we agreed among ourselves to give the
ship to those of our company who had no
money left them of all their purchase in this
voyage, having lost it at play, and then put
ourselves on board two ships bound for England.
So I myself and thirteen more of our
company went on board Captain Robert
Porteen's ship called the <i>Lisbon Merchant</i>,
set sail from La Antigua February 11th,
and landed in England March 26th, anno
1682."</p>

<p>On his arrival in England Captain Sharp
was tried for piracy and acquitted. He at
once resolved to return to the West Indies,
but all the merchant ships refused to carry
him, afraid he would tempt their men to
revolt against their master, and run away
with the ship for a privateer, as he had done
before. No promises or entreaties could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
avail, and he seemed doomed to remain a
prisoner in an island for which he entertained
no filial affection.</p>

<p>He therefore hit upon a desperate scheme,
worthy of such a man. Collecting a little
money he bought an old, half-rotten boat,
lying near London-bridge, for £20, and embarked
with sixteen desperadoes equally
fearless as himself, carrying a supply of butter
and cheese, and two dozen pieces of salt beef.
He sailed down the river and reached the
Downs, and there he boarded and captured a
French vessel and sank his boat. By a
foray on Romney Marsh he supplied himself
with cattle, and sailed away like a bold Buccaneer
as he was, to die no one knows where.</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span></p>

<p>Dampier, one of the wisest and best of
English travellers, was himself a Buccaneer.
Son of a Somersetshire farmer, he went early
to sea, and became a freebooter without much
compunction, just at the time when the
brothers of the coast were sinking into mere
pirates. "No peace beyond the line" was
their early motto; "Friends to God and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
enemies to all mankind," was the later. The
flag, once reddened by the Spaniards' blood,
grew now black with the shadows of death
and of the grave.</p>

<p>Dampier was among those who left Captain
Sharp after the dreadful repulse from
Arica. His party consisted of forty-four
Englishmen and two Mosquito Indians, who
determined to re-cross the Isthmus of Darien,
and return to the North Pacific Ocean. They
carried with them a large quantity of flour
and chocolate mixed with sugar, and took a
mutual and terrible oath, that if any of their
number sank from fatigue, he should be shot
by his comrades, rather than allow him to
fall into the hands of the Spaniards, who
would not only torture him horribly, but
compel him to betray his companions.</p>

<p>In a fortnight after leaving the vessels they
landed at the mouth of a river in the Bay of
St. Michael, where unloading their provisions
and arms they sank their boats; and while
preparing for the inland journey, the Indians
caught fish, and built huts for them to sleep
in. The next day they struck into an Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
path and reached a village, but found, to
their alarm, that the Spaniards had placed
armed ships at the mouths of all the navigable
rivers to intercept them on their
return. Hiring an Indian guide, they reached
the day after a native house, but the
savage would neither give them food nor
information. At any other time the Buccaneers
would have at once put him on the
rack, or hung him at his own door, but they
felt this was no place to be angry, for their
lives lay in the enemy's hands. Neither
dollars, hatchets, nor knives, would move
this stubborn man, till a sailor pulled a sky
blue petticoat from his bag and threw it over
the head of the Indian's wife. Delighted with
the gift, she coaxed her husband till he gave
them information and found a guide. It had
rained hard for two days, the country was
difficult and fatiguing, and there was no
path that even an Indian eye could discover.
They guided themselves by day by
the rivers, and at night by the stars. They
had frequently to ford the rivers twenty
or thirty times in twelve hours. Rain, cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
fatigue, and hunger made them forget even
the Spaniards.</p>

<p>In a few days they reached the house of a
young Spanish Indian, who had lived with
the bishop of Panama, and who received them
kindly. Here, while resting to dry their
arms and powder, their surgeon, Mr. Wafer,
had his knee burnt by an accidental explosion.
After dragging himself along with pain for
another day, he determined to remain behind
with two or three more. He stayed five
months with the Indians, and the published
account of his experiences still exists.</p>

<p>The rainy season that frightened Mr. Ringrose
had now set in, and the thunder and
lightning was frequent and violent. The
valleys and river banks were overflowed, and
the Buccaneers had to sleep in trees or under
their shade, instead of building warm and
sheltering huts. In the very height of their
misery, the slaves fled and carried away all
they could. Dampier, whose only anxiety
was to preserve his journal, placed it in a
bamboo, closed at both ends with wax. In
fording one of the rivers, a Buccaneer, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
carried 300 dollars on his back, was swept
down the stream and drowned, but the survivors
were too hopeless and weary to look
for either body or gold.</p>

<p>In eighteen days the English reached the
river Concepcion, and, obtaining Indian
canoes, rowed to Le Sound's Key, one of the
Samballas islands, where Buccaneers rendezvoused.
Here they embarked on board a
French privateer, commanded by Captain
Tristian, dismissing their Indian guides
with presents of money, beads, and hatchets.
At Springer's Key, Tristian joined them with
other vessels, and would have attacked Panama
had not Dampier and his men deterred
them. For a week the council deliberated
about the available towns worth
plundering from Trinidad to Vera Cruz. The
French and English could not agree, but at
last all sailed for Carpenter's River, touching
at the isle of St. Andreas. The ships
separated in a gale; and Dampier taking a
dislike to his French commander, induced Captain
Wright, an Englishman, to fit out a small
vessel and cruise for provisions along the coast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
While the sailors shot pecary, deer, parrots,
pigeons, monkeys, and cuvassow birds, their
Mosquito Indians struck turtle for their use.</p>

<p>On returning to Le Sound's Key they were
joined by Mr. Wafer, who had escaped from
the Darien Indians, but he was so painted
and bedizened that it was some time before
they could recognize him. An Indian chief
had offered him his daughter in marriage,
and he had only got away by pretending
to go in search of English dogs for hunting.
Passing Carthagena, they cast wistful eyes
at the convent dedicated to the Virgin, situated
on a steep hill behind the town. There
was immense wealth hoarded in this place,
rich offerings being frequently made to it,
and many miracles worked by our Lady.
Any misfortune that befel the Buccaneer
was attributed to this Lady's doing, and the
Spaniards reported that she was abroad that
night the <i>Oxford</i> man-of-war blew up at
the isle of Vaca, and that she came home
all wet, and with clothes soiled and torn.</p>

<p>Captain Wright's company pillaged several
small places about the Rio de la Hache<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
and the Rancherias pearl fisheries, and captured,
after a smart engagement, an armed
ship of twelve guns and forty men, laden
with sugar, tobacco, and marmalade, bound
to Carthagena from Santiago, in Cuba. The
Dutch governor of Curaçoa, having much
trade with the Spaniards, would not openly
buy the cargo, but offered, if it was sent
among the Danes of St. Thomas, to purchase
it through his agents. The rovers, declining
this, sold it at another Dutch colony,
and then sailed for the isle of Aves, so called
from the quantity of boobies and men-of-war
birds. On a coral reef, near this island,
Count d'Estrees had shortly before lost the
whole French fleet. He himself had first run
ashore, and firing guns to warn the rest of
the danger, they hurried on to the same
shoal, thinking, in the darkness, that he
had been attacked by the enemy. The ships
held together till the next day, and many
men were saved. The ordinary seamen died
of hunger and fatigue, but the Buccaneers,
hardier, and accustomed to frequent wrecks,
made the escape an excuse for revel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
debauchery. As Dampier says, they, "being
used to such accidents, lived merrily, and if
they had gone to Jamaica with £30 in their
pockets, could not have enjoyed themselves
more; for they kept a gang by themselves
and watched when the ships broke up, to
get the goods that came out of them, and,
though much was staved against the rocks,
yet abundance of wine and brandy floated
over the reef where they waited to take it
up." * * "There were about forty Frenchmen
on board one of the ships, in which
was good store of liquor, till the after part
of her broke, and floated over the reef and
was carried away to sea, with all the men
drinking and singing, who, being in drink,
did not mind the danger, but were never
heard of afterwards."</p>

<p>This wreck having left the Bird Island a
storehouse of masts and spars, the Buccaneer
vessels had begun to repair thither to careen
and refit. Among others, a Captain Pan, a
Frenchman, had been there. A Dutch vessel
of twenty guns, despatched from Curaçoa
to fish up the sunken cannon, observing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
privateer, resolved to capture him before he
began his diving. Pan, afraid of the Dutchman's
superior force, abandoned his vessel,
and, landing his guns, prepared to throw up
a redoubt. While thus engaged, a Dutch
sloop entered the road, and at night anchored
at the opposite end of the island. In the
night, Pan, with two canoes, boarded the
ship, and made off, leaving his empty hulk
for the Dutch man-of-war.</p>

<p>At this island, Dampier's men careened
their largest vessel, scrubbed the sugar prize,
and recovered two guns from the wreck.
At the island of Rocas, a Knight of Malta,
captain of a French thirty-six gun ship,
bought ten tons of their sugar. Failing to
sell any more sugar at Petit Guaves, they
sailed for Blanco, an uninhabited island, full
of lignum-vitæ trees, and teeming with iguanas,
that were to be found in the swamps,
among the bushes, or in the trees. Their
eggs were eaten by the Buccaneers, who
made soup of the flesh for their sick.</p>

<p>While cruising on the Caraccas coast, they
landed in some of the bays, and took seven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
or eight tons of cocoa, and three barks laden
with hides, brandy, earthenware, and European
goods. Returning to the Rocas, they
divided the spoil, and Dampier and nineteen
others embarking in one of the prizes,
reached Virginia July 1682.</p>

<p>Dampier's next voyage was with a Creole,
named Cook, who arrived at Virginia with a
French vessel he had captured by a trick at
Petit Guaves. He had been quartermaster,
or second in command, under a French Flibustier
named Gandy. By the usual Buccaneer
law, he had been made captain of a
large Spanish prize. The French commanders
in the same fleet, jealous of this promotion,
seized the ship, plundered the English
prize crew, and sent them ashore. Tristan,
another French captain, took ten of them
with him to Petit Guaves. Cook and his
nine companions, taking advantage of a day
when Tristan and many of his men were absent,
overpowered the rest of the crew, sent them
ashore, and sailed to the Isle à la Vache. Here
he picked up a crew of English Buccaneers,
and steered for Virginia, taking two prizes by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
the way, one of which was a French vessel,
laden with wines. He then sold his wine and
two of the ships, and equipped the largest,
the <i>Revenge</i>, with eighteen guns. Amongst
the crew were Dampier, Wafer, and Cowley,
all of whom have written narratives of their
voyages. They sailed from the Chesapeak
on the 23rd of August 1683, and captured a
Dutch vessel, laden with wine and provisions.
At the Cape de Verd islands they
encountered a dreadful storm, that lasted a
week. While the ship scudded before wind
and sea under bare poles, she was suddenly
broached to by order of the master, and would
have foundered but for Dampier and another
man who, going aloft and spreading out
the flaps of their coats, righted the ship. At
the isle of Sal, the sailors feasted on flamingo
tongues. These birds stood in ranks round the
feeding ponds, so as to resemble a new brick
wall. They purchased here some ambergris,
which Dampier says he had in a lump of
100 lbs. weight. Its origin was at that
time unknown; it is now believed to be a
secretion of the whale. The governor and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
his court at this island rejoiced in rags, their
revenues being small, and drawn principally
from the salt ponds, from which the island
derives its name. Having dug wells, watered,
and careened, they went to Mayo to obtain
provisions, but were not allowed to land, as
only about a week before Captain Bond, a
pirate of Bristol, had carried off the governor
and some of his people.</p>

<p>Steering to the Straits of Magellan, they
were driven to the Guinea coast, and there
captured a Danish ship by a stratagem.
Captain Cook, concealing his men under deck,
approached the Dane like a weak, unarmed
merchant vessel. When quite close, he commanded
in a loud voice the helm to be put
one way, while by a preconcerted plan the
steersman shifted into another, and fell on
board the Dane, which was captured with
the loss of only five men. She was double
their size, carried thirty-six guns, and was
equipped and victualled for a long voyage.</p>

<p>This vessel they called <i>The Bachelor's
Delight</i>, and they at once burned the <i>Revenge</i>,
that she might "tell no tales."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>During frequent tornadoes near the straits,
being short of fresh meat, the sailors
caught sharks during the calms, and boiling
their flesh, stewed it with pepper and vinegar.
When they reached the Falkland, or Sebald
de Weist islands, as they were then called,
Dampier proposed to the captain to reach
Juan Fernandez by Cape Horn, avoiding the
straits. Their men being privateers, wilful,
and not much in command, he feared would
not give sufficient attention in a passage so
difficult, and, though he owns they were
more than usually obedient, he says he could
not expect to find them at an instant's call in
critical moments. At these islands they
found the sea for a mile round red with
shoals of small, scarlet-shelled lobsters. Dampier's
advice was not taken, but on entering
the South Sea they met the <i>Nicholas</i>, of
London, a vessel fitted out ostensibly as a
trader, but being in reality a Buccaneer.
The captain came on board, related his adventures,
and gave them a supply of bread
and beef. They reached Juan Fernandez
together, and heard from the <i>Nicholas</i> of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
vessel from London, called the <i>Cygnet</i>, commanded
by Captain Swan, which was sailing
in those latitudes. It was a trader, holding
a licence from the Duke of York, then High
Admiral of England.</p>

<p>The crews discovered on the island the
Mosquito Indian left behind by Captain Watling,
in Lussan's expedition, because he was
hunting goats when the vessel sailed. He
was warmly greeted by Dampier, a fellow-countryman
named Robin, and some old
messmates. Robin, running up to him, fell
flat on his face at his feet, and then rose and
embraced him. They found he had killed
three goats, and prepared some cabbage palms,
to feast his visitors. The interview, writes
Dampier, was tender, solemn, and affecting.
When abandoned, William had nothing with
him but his gun and a knife, some powder,
and some shot. By notching his knife into
a saw, he cut his gun barrel into pieces.
These he hammered in the fire, and ground
them into lances, harpoons, hooks, and knives.
He hunted goats, fished, and killed seals.
His clothes he made of skins, and with these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
also he had lined his hut; and he had contrived
to elude the search of the Spaniards.
Wild goats, originally brought by the Spaniard,
abounded on the hills and in the grassy
valleys. There was abundance of water and
good timber, and the bays abounded with seals
and sea-lions, that covered the sea for a mile.</p>

<p>Remaining here sixteen days, for the sake
of the sick and those ill with the scurvy,
and getting in water and provision, Cook
then steered for the American coast, standing
out fourteen or fifteen leagues to escape the
notice of the Spaniard. The ridges were
blue and mountainous. They soon captured
a timber ship from Guayaquil laden with
timber for Lima, from whose crew they heard
that their arrival was known. They anchored
next at the sandy islet of Lobos de la Mar,
and scrubbed their ships. Captain Eaton, of
the <i>Nicholas</i>, proposing to march with them in
their descents, and the two vessels mustering
108 able men, Cook soon took another
prize, and Eaton two more, which he pursued.
They were laden with flour from
Lima for Panama, and in one of them was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
eight tons of quince marmalade. The prisoners
informed them that, on the rumour of
their approach, 800,000 pieces of eight had
been landed at an intermediate port. They
sailed next to the Galapagos islands, abandoning
a design on Truxillo, which they heard
had been lately fortified. On these rocky,
barren shores they feasted on turtle, pigeons,
fish, and the leaves of the mammee tree. Off
Cape Blanco, Captain Cook died, and was
buried on land.</p>

<p>Capturing some Spanish Indians who had
been sent as spies by the Governor of Panama,
they used them as guides, and landed
on the coast in search of cattle. Here a few
of the men were surprised by fifty armed
Spaniards, and their boat burned. The
sailors thus imperilled waded out neck deep
to an insulated rock near the shore, and remained
there for seven hours exposed to the
Spanish bullets, till they were taken off by a
boat from their ship just as the tide was
rising to devour them. The Spanish, lurking
in ambush, made no attempt to resist the
rescue.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>The quartermaster, Edward Davis, was
now elected commander; and after cutting
lancewood for the handles of their oars, they
bore away for Ria Lexa, steering for a high
volcano that rises above the town and the
island that forms the harbour. But here,
too, the Spaniards had thrown up breast-works
and placed sentinels, and the Buccaneers
sailed for the Gulf of Ampalla and the island
of Mangera. Davis captured the padre of a
village and two Indian boys, and, proceeding
to Ampalla, informed the people that he commanded
a Biscay ship, sent by the King of
Spain to clear those seas of pirates, and that
he had come there to careen. The sailors
were well received, and entertained with
feasts and music, and they all repaired together
to celebrate a festival by torchlight
in the church. Here Davis hoped to cage
them till he could dictate a ransom, but the
impatience of one of his men frustrated the
plan. Pushing in a lingering Indian, the
man spread an alarm, the people all fled,
and the Buccaneers, firing, killed one of
their chiefs. They remained, however, good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
friends, and these very Indians soon after
helped to store the ship with cattle belonging
to a nunnery, situated on an island in the
gulf. On leaving, Davis gave them one
of his prize ships, and a quantity of flour,
and released the priest who had helped him
in his first stratagem.</p>

<p>The crews now quarrelled, and Davis, who
claimed the largest share of the common
plunder, left them, taking Dampier with
him. Eaton touched at Cocos island, purchased
a store of flour, and took in water and cocoa
nuts. Davis landed at Manta, a village near
Cape St. Lorenzo, and captured two old
women, in order to obtain information.
They learnt that many Buccaneers had lately
crossed the isthmus, and were coming along
the coast in canoes and piraguas. The
viceroy had left no means untried to check
them; the goats on the uninhabited islands
had been destroyed, provisions were removed
from the shore, and ships even burnt to save
them from the enemy. At La Plata, Davis
was joined by Captain Swan in the <i>Cygnet</i>,
who had turned freebooter in self-defence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
He had been joined by Peter Harris, who
commanded a small bark, and was nephew of
the Buccaneer commander killed in a sea-fight
at Panama three years before. They
now sent for Eaton, but found from a letter
at the rendezvous at Lobos, that he had already
sailed for the East Indies. While the
ships were refitting at La Plata, a small bark
taken by Davis, after the Spaniards had set
it on fire, captured a Spaniard of 400 tons,
laden with timber, and brought word that
the viceroy was fitting out ten frigates to
sweep them from the seas. Captain Swan,
at this crisis, turned wholly freebooter, and
cleared his ship of goods by selling them to
every Buccaneer on credit. The bulky bales
he threw overboard, the silks and muslins he
kept, and retained the iron bars for ballast.
In compensation for these sacrifices, the
Buccaneers agreed to set aside ten shares of
all booty for Captain Swan's owners.</p>

<p>Having cleaned the vessels and fitted up a
fire-ship, the squadron landed at Paita, but
found it deserted. Anchoring off the place,
they demanded as ransom 300 pecks of flour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
3000 pounds of sugar, twenty-five jars of
wine, and 1000 of water, and having coasted
six days and obtained nothing, they burnt
the town in revenge, and sailed away. They
found afterwards that Eaton had been there
not long before, landed his prisoners, and
burnt a ship in the road. Burning Harris's
vessel, which proved unseaworthy, the squadron
steered for the island of Lobos del Tierra,
and, being short of food, took in a supply of
seals, penguins, and boobies, their Mosquito
men supplying them with turtle, while the
ships were cleaned and provided with firewood,
preparatory to a descent upon Guayaquil.
Embarking in their canoes, they captured in
the bay a small ship laden with Quito cloth
and two vessels full of negroes. One of these
they dismasted, and a few only of the slaves
they took with them. From disagreement
between the two crews, the expedition failed.
Having lain in the woods all night, and cut
a road with great difficulty, they abandoned
the scheme without firing a shot, when almost
within a mile of the town, which they believed
was alarmed, and on the watch.</p>

<p>Dampier now proposed a scheme as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
feasible and grand as any of Raleigh's. He
declared that they never had a greater opportunity
of enriching themselves. His bold
plan was, with the 1000 negroes lying in the
three prizes, to go and work the gold mines
of St. Martha. The Indians would at once
join them from their hatred of the Spaniards.
For provision they had 200 tons of flour laid
up in the Galapagos islands; the North Sea
would be open to them; thousands of Buccaneers
would join them from all parts of the
West Indies; united they would be a match
for all the forces of Peru, and might be at once
masters of the west coast as high as Quito.
This golden cloud melted into mere fog. The
Buccaneers returned to La Plata, divided the
Quito cloth, and turned the Guayaquil vessel
into a tender for the <i>Swan</i>. The old Buccaneers
of Davis now quarrelled with the
new recruits in the <i>Swan</i>, accused them
of cowardice and of having baulked the
attempt on Guayaquil, and complained of
having to supply them with flour and
turtle, for they had neither provisions nor
Indian fishermen. Unable to divorce, the ill-assorted
pair proceeded to attack together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Lavelia, in the Bay of Panama. From charts
found in the prizes they checked the deceptions
and errors of the Spanish and Indian
prisoners whom they employed as pilots. Their
object was now to search for canoes in rivers
unvisited by the Spaniards, where their
schemes might remain still undiscovered.</p>

<p>Such rivers abounded from the equinoctial
line to the Gulf of St. Michael. When five
days out from La Plata they made a sudden
swoop on the village of Tomaco, and captured
a vessel laden with timber, with a Spanish
knight, eight sailors, and a canoe containing
twelve jars of old wine. A boat party
that rowed up the St. Jago river visited a
house belonging to a lady of Lima, whose
servants traded with the Indians for gold,
several ounces of which were found left by
them in their calabashes when they fled.</p>

<p>The twin vessels next sailed for the island
of Gallo, capturing by the way a packet boat
from Lima, fishing up the letters, which the
Spaniards had thrown overboard attached to
a buoy. From these they learnt that the
governor of Panama was hastening the departure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
of the triennial plate fleet from Callo
to Panama, where it would be carried on
mules across the isthmus. To intercept this
fleet and to grow millionaires in a day was
now their only dream. They proceeded at
once to careen their ships at the Pearl islands
in the bay of Panama. Their force consisted
of two ships, three barks, a fire-ship,
and two small tenders. Near the uninhabited
island of Gorgona they captured a flour ship,
and landing most of their prisoners at Gorgona,
they proceeded to the bay, captured
a small provision boat, and continued their
watch, cruising round the city.</p>

<p>Having cut off all communication between
Panama and the islands in the bay, Davis
proposed an exchange of prisoners, surrendering
forty monks, whom he was glad to get
rid of, for one of Harris's band and a sailor
who had been surprised while hunting on an
island. The Lima fleet still delaying, the
Buccaneers anchored at Tavoga, an island
abounding in cocoa and mammee trees, and
beautiful water. About this time they were
nearly ensnared by a Spanish ship, sent to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
island at midnight under pretence of clandestine
traffic. This scheme originated in
Captain Bond, an English pirate who had
deserted to the enemy. The squadron, which
had scattered in alarm, to avoid the fire-ship,
were just re-uniting and looking for their
abandoned anchors, when a cry rose that a
fleet of armed canoes were steering direct
towards them through the island channel.
This was the French Flibustiers of which we
have given an account in the adventures of
Ravenau de Lussan. After joining in the
sea-fight off Panama, and the descent upon
Leon and Ria Lexa, the Buccaneers again split
into small parties. Dampier joined Swan and
Townley, who determined to cruise along the
shores of the mine country of Mexico, and
then, sailing as high as the south-west point of
California, cross the Pacific, and return to
England by India. At Guatalico, famous for
its blowing rock, they landed their sick for a
few days, and obtained provisions, and, in a
descent near Acapulco, stopped a string of
sixty laden mules and killed eighteen beeves,
carrying off all the cattle safely to their ships.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain provisions, Swan sacked the
town of St. Pecaque, on the coast of New
Gallicia, where large stores were kept for
the use of the slaves of the neighbouring
mines. A great many of these he carried off
the first day on horseback and on the
shoulders of his men. These visits were repeated&mdash;a
party of Buccaneers keeping the
town till the Spaniards had collected a force.
Of this Captain Swan gave his men due warning,
exhorting them, on their way to their
canoes with the burdens of maize, to keep
together in a compact body, but they chose
to follow their own course, every man
straggling singly while leading his horse, or
carrying a load on his shoulder. They accordingly
fell into the ambush the Spaniards
had laid for them, and to the amount of
fifty were surprised and mercilessly
butchered. The Spaniards, seizing their
arms and loaded horses, fled, before Swan,
who heard the distant firing, could come to
the assistance of his men. Fifty-four Englishmen
and nine blacks fell in this affair,
which was the most severe the Buccaneers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
had encountered in the South Sea. Dampier
relates that Captain Swan had been warned
of this disaster by an astrologer he had consulted
before he sailed from England. Many
of the men, too, had foreboded the misfortune;
and the previous night, while lying in the
church of St. Pecaque, had been disturbed
by frequent groanings which kept them from
sleeping.</p>

<p>This disaster drove Swan from the coast to
careen at Cape St. Lucas, the south point of
California&mdash;in revenge for his loss leaving
his pilot and prisoners on an uninhabited
island. While lying here, Dampier was
cured of dropsy by being buried all but his
head in hot sand. The whole 150 men were
now living on short allowances of maize, and
the fish the Indians struck salted for store.
One meal a-day was now the rule, and the
victuals were served out by the quartermaster
with the exactness of gold. Yet,
even in this distress, two dogs and two cats
received their daily shares. They now
started for their cruise among the Philippines.
In a long run of 7,302 miles they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
saw no living thing&mdash;neither bird, fish, nor
insect, except one solitary flight of boobies.
At the end of the voyage the men were
almost in mutiny at the want of food, and
had secretly resolved to kill and eat their
captain (Swan), and afterwards, in regular
order, all who had promoted the voyage.
At the island of Gualan, where there was a
Spanish fort and a garrison of thirty men,
the Buccaneers traded with the natives, who
took them for Spaniards from Acapulco.</p>

<p>Captain Eaton, who had visited the island
before them on his way to India, had, at the
instigation of the Spaniards, plundered and
killed many of the natives, and driven the
rest to emigration. While trading here the
Acapulco vessel arrived, and, being signalled
by the governor, took to flight; but in her
hurry to escape ran upon a shoal, from which
she was with difficulty extricated. Swan,
who now grew anxious for quiet commerce,
discouraged the pursuit, and proceeded
quietly on his voyage. At Mindanao, Captain
Swan and thirty-six men were left behind
by his crew, who were only anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
for plunder, and soon after captured a Spanish
vessel bound for Manilla. Captain
Swan was eventually drowned while attempting
to escape to a Dutch vessel lying in the
river. Weary of the mean robberies of the
crew, who now turned mere pirates, Dampier
left them at the Nicobar islands, and, embarking
in canoes, reached Sumatra, and
eventually sailed for England.</p>

<p>The Buccaneers left behind in the South
Sea prospered, and made many successful
descents. At Lavelia Townley captured the
treasure and merchandise landed from the
Lima ship in the former year, for which
Swan had watched so long in vain, and for
which the Buccaneers had fought in the Bay
of Panama. Townley died of his wounds.
Harris followed Swan across the Pacific;
and Knight, another English Buccaneer,
satiated with plunder, returned home laden
with Spanish gold; and off Cape Corrientes
they lay in wait in vain for the Manilla
ship, the great prize aimed at by all adventurers.
Soon after, a malignant fever breaking
out among the crews, many left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
squadron and returned towards Panama,
carrying back the Darien Indians, but leaving
the Mosquito Indians in the <i>Cygnet</i>.</p>

<p>Davis sailed from Guayaquil to careen at
the Galapagos islands, which were in the
South Pacific what Tortuga was in the North,
the harbour and sanctuary of the Buccaneers.
In returning by Cape Horn, Davis discovered
Easter island, and left five of his men and
five negro slaves on Juan Fernandez. These
men had been stripped at the gambling-table,
and were unwilling to return empty-handed.
The <i>Bachelor's Delight</i> eventually doubled
Cape Horn, and he reached the West Indies
just in time to avail himself of a pardon
offered by royal proclamation.</p>

<p>Dampier reached England in 1691, and
having published his travels, was sent out in
1691 by William III. on a voyage of discovery
to New Holland, and was wrecked
near Ascension. In Queen Anne's reign,
during the war of the succession, he commanded
two privateers, and cruised against
the Spaniards in the South Sea. His objects
were to capture the Spanish plate vessels sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
from Buenos Ayres, to lie in wait for the
gold ship from Boldivia to Lima, and to seize
the Manilla galleon. Off Juan Fernandez
he fought a French Buccaneer vessel for
seven hours, but parted without effecting
a capture. So strong were his old Flibustier
habits upon him, that he confesses
it with reluctance he attacked any vessel not
a Spaniard. Before they reached the proper
latitude the Boldivia vessel had sailed.</p>

<p>Captain Stradling, the commander of his
companion ship, parted company. A surprise
of Santa Maria, in the bay of Panama, failed,
but Dampier made a few small prizes.
While lying in the gulf of Nicoya, his chief
mate, John Clipperton, mutinied, and, seizing
his tender, with its ammunition and stores,
put out to sea. A worse disappointment
awaited the commander&mdash;off the Fort de
Narida he came suddenly upon the Manilla
galleon, and gave her several broadsides
before she could clear for action. But even
at this disadvantage the Spaniards' twenty-four
pounders soon silenced Dampier's five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
pounders, drove in the rotten planks of his
vessel, the <i>St. George</i>, and compelled him to
sheer off&mdash;the galleon's crew quadrupling
that of the English.</p>

<p>The men growing despondent and weary
of the voyage, Dampier put thirty-four of
them into a prize brigantine of seventy tons,
and appointed one named Funnel as their
commander. Allowing them to sail for
India, he with twenty-nine men returned to
Peru and plundered the town of Puna. The
vessel being no longer fit for sea, they abandoned
her at Lobos de la Mar, and embarking
in a Spanish brigantine crossed the
Pacific. In India, Dampier, having had his
commission stolen by some of his deserters,
was imprisoned by the Dutch. When he
reached England at last, he found that
Funnel had returned and published his
voyage to the West Indies. A few of his
men who had lost their money in gambling
remained in the <i>Bachelor's Delight</i> with
Davis.</p>

<p>It is supposed he now fell into very extreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
poverty, for in 1708 we find him acting as
pilot to the two Bristol privateers that circumnavigated
the globe, and were as successful
as he had been unfortunate. At Juan
Fernandez the commander, Woodes Rogers,
brought off the celebrated Alexander Selkirk,
who had been abandoned here four years
before, by Dampier's mutinous consort, Captain
Stradling, and, by the traveller's advice,
the poor outcast was made second mate of the
<i>Duke</i>. At Guayaquil, where Dampier commanded
the artillery, they obtained plunder
to the value of £21,000, besides 27,000 dollars,
as ransom for the town. Off Cape Lucas
they captured a rich Manilla ship, laden with
merchandise, and containing £12,000 in gold
and silver. They also encountered the great
Manilla galleon, but were beaten off after a
severe engagement with a loss of twenty-five
men. After a run of two months they
reached Gualan, and obtained provisions by
anchoring under Spanish colours. Visiting
Batavia, they waited a long time at the Cape
for a home-bound fleet, and in July, 1711,
entered the Texel five-and-twenty sail, Dutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
and English; and in October sailed up the
Thames with booty valued at £150,000. Of
the great Dampier we hear no more, and his
very burial place is unknown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Van Horn</span> was originally a common Dutch
sailor, who, having, by dint of the prudence
of his nation, saved 200 dollars, entered
into partnership with a messmate who had
laid by the same sum, and, going to France,
obtained a privateer's commission, and fitted
up a fishing-boat with a crew of thirty men.
Cruising first as Dutch, he then purchased
a large vessel at Ostend, and, hoisting the
French flag, made war on all nations. The
French court ordered M. d'Estrees to detain
this Flying Dutchman, whose commission
had now expired, and a ship was sent for
the purpose; but as the commander had no
orders to proceed to extremities, and Van
Horn was determined not to go alive, he
was suffered to escape. Quite undaunted
he proceeded to Puerto Rico, entered the
bay, sounding his trumpets, and, sending
on shore, told the governor that he had come
to offer his services to escort the galleons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
which were then ready to sail. The governor
accepted the offer, and Van Horn sailed
off with them; but being soon joined by
some Buccaneer companions, he turned on
the prey, seized the richest, sank some
others, and pursued the rest. Such was
the commencement of this adventurer's
career. His after life was worthy of such
a beginning.</p>

<p>Van Horn was immensely rich. He usually
wore a string of pearls of extraordinary size,
and a large ruby of great beauty. His
widow lived afterwards at Ostend.</p>

<p>In 1683, Van Horn, who had all his life
fought under French colours, though not
very scrupulous about what nation a vessel
was, so it were rich, having gone to St.
Domingo to sell negroes, had his ship confiscated
by the Spanish governor. The Buccaneer's
ungovernable passions could no
more brook such an insult than a knight
would have borne a blow. Buccaneer pride
desired revenge; Buccaneer cupidity desired
redress. Resolved on vengeance, the angry
Dutchman hastened to Petit Guaves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
took out a commission from the governor of
Tortuga, and at once enrolled 300 of the
bravest Buccaneers, with a determination of
attacking Vera Cruz. Among his crew were
enrolled several of the leading Buccaneer
chiefs. Grammont, who had lately lost his
ship at the Isles des Aves, lately a commander,
was now a mere volunteer. Such
were the vicissitudes of Buccaneer life.
Laurence de Graff was also there. He was a
Dutchman like Van Horn, but one came
from Ostend and the other from Dort.
Among the less celebrated were Godefroy
and Jonqué. Their numbers soon swelled
to 1,200 picked men, in six vessels, under
the command of Van Horn and De Graff,
who had each a frigate of fifty guns, while
the rest had simple barks. Their common
aim was Vera Cruz, the emporium of all the
riches of New Spain, and they needed no
other incitement to urge them to speed and
unity.</p>

<p>From some Spanish prisoners they heard
that two large vessels laden with cocoa were
hourly expected at Vera Cruz from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Caraccas. The Buccaneer leaders instantly
fitted up two of their largest ships in the
Spanish fashion, and, hoisting the Spanish
flag, sent them boldly into the harbour, as if
just returning as peaceful but armed traders
from a long and successful voyage. It was
the eve of the Assumption, crowds of sailors
and townsmen lined the quays, and the expectant
populace cheered the rich merchantmen
as they steered with a stately sweep
into the haven. The keener eyes, however,
soon observed that the Caraccas vessels advanced
very slowly, although the wind was
good, and their suspicions became excited
almost before the Buccaneers could work
into port. Some even ran to tell the governor
that all was not right, but Don Luis de
Cordova told them that their fears were
foolish, the two vessels he knew by unmistakable
signs to be the two vessels he
expected; and he returned the same answer to
the commander of the fort at St. Jean d'Ulloa,
who also sent to bid him be upon his guard.</p>

<p>About midnight the French, under cover
of the dark, landed at the old town, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
three leagues to the west of the more modern
city. They obtained easy access to the place,
and surprised the governor in his bed. The
drowsy sentinels once overpowered, the small
fortress with its twelve guns was in the
possession of their men. At every corner
pickets were placed. The surprise was so
complete, that when the tocsin rang at daybreak,
the watchmen being alarmed at some
musket shots they heard, they found the town
already bound hand and foot. At the first
clang of the bell, the garrison rushed out of
their barracks, and ranged themselves under
their colours, but saw the French already in
arms at the head of all the principal streets.
They were surrounded and helpless. When
the day broke, nobody dare show themselves,
for all those who ran out armed were
instantly struck down. Sentinels were placed
at every door in the principal streets, a
barrel of powder with the lid off by their
sides, ready to fire the train that connected
one with the other at the least signal of
danger. We believe it was on this occasion
that Van Horn forced a monk into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
cathedral, who preached to the people on
the vanity of worldly riches, and the necessity
of abandoning them to the spoiler. The
Buccaneers then drove all the Spaniards into
their houses, and forced the women and
children into the churches. Here they
remained, crowded together, weeping and
hungry, for three days, while their enemies
collected the booty. The Buccaneers, now
safe, abandoned themselves, as usual, to
debauchery and gluttony&mdash;some dying from
immoderate gluttony. Fortunately for this
wretched people, the bishop of the town,
happening to be near Vera Cruz at the
time, began to treat for their ransom. It
was fixed at two million piastres, of which
a part was paid the very same day&mdash;the
Buccaneers only dispensing with the remaining
million, as the Vice-Royal was
already approaching the town at the head of
a large force. Dangers were now hemming
in the Dutchman and his band. About
eleven o'clock in the morning, the look-out
on the tower of St. Catherine's reported that a
fleet of fourteen sail was approaching the city.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<p>The Buccaneers, alarmed, sprang to arms.
Aghast at this intelligence, the French,
dreading to be shut in between two fires,
decided upon an immediate retreat. The
townspeople, terrified at the prospect of
being massacred by their infuriated and
despairing enemies, were as apprehensive of
danger as the Buccaneers themselves. Van
Horn embarked with speed all the plate
and cochineal, and the more valuable and
portable of the spoil, and waited eagerly for
the ransom which was now almost in sight.
It, however, never arrived, for the drivers of
the mules, hearing the firing, halted till the
fleet came within sight. The Buccaneers
had no time to lose, and compensated themselves
by carrying off 1,500 slaves to their
vessels, which lay moored at some leagues'
distance, at Grijaluc, a place of safety.</p>

<p>They spent the night in great disorder, in
continual apprehension of being attacked by
the Spanish fleet, which was, at the same
time, congratulating itself on reaching Vera
Cruz unharmed. The danger of the Buccaneers
was indeed not yet removed, for they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
had neither water nor sufficient provisions,
and some 1,500 prisoners were on board.
About these hostages the leaders differed in
opinion, and words ran high. The two
chiefs fought, and Van Horn received a
sword thrust in the arm from De Graff.
The several crews took up their captains'
quarrels, and would have come to blows, had
not De Graff divided the prey, and at once
set sail. Van Horn followed, but died on
the passage, a gangrene having formed upon
a wound at first very slight. He was devotedly
beloved by his men, says Charlevoix,
though he was in the habit of cutting down
any sailor whom he saw flinch at his guns.
He left his frigate with his dying breath to
Grammont, who reached St. Domingo, after
dreadful sufferings, having lost three-fourths
of his prisoners by famine&mdash;his patache being
cast away and taken by the Spaniards. De
Graff's vessel was also wrecked, but the
crew made their way one by one to St. Domingo,
where, in spite of the ill reception of
the governor, they were welcomed by the
hospitality of the inhabitants, who longed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
share the treasure of Vera Cruz. The
governor, M. de Franquesnoy, without fortress
or garrison, and exposed to the inroads
of the Spaniards, could make no resistance
to these wild refugees, who, on one occasion,
hearing that he intended to seize upon
part of the Vera Cruz booty, surrounded
his house to the number of 120 men,
and threatened his life. At this time, a
general outbreak of the French was expected.</p>

<p>It was in the very next year that the
governor of Carthagena, hearing that Michael
le Basque and Jonqué were cruising near his
port, sent two vessels against them, one of
48 guns and 300 men, and the other of
40 guns and 250 men, with a small bark as
a decoy. The Buccaneer chiefs each commanded
a vessel of 30 guns and 200 men.
They both grappled the Spaniards, held
them for an hour and a-half, swept their
decks with musketry, tortured them with
hand grenades and missiles, and eventually
bore them off in triumph. All the Spaniards
who were not killed were put on shore with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
a note to the governor, thanking him for
having sent them two such good vessels, as
their own had long been unfit for service.
They, moreover, promised to wait fifteen
days off Carthagena for any other vessel he
might wish to get rid of, provided he would
send money in them, of which they were in
great need.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
